SUPERVISOR MOORE
The first (1st) item on the Agenda tonight is a Public Hearing for a proposed rezoning of
approximately forty-six point five (46.5) acres of land located on Ward Hill Road from a
Residential RR-2 to a Residential RR-1 by Lacey Development. Would the applicant and

TB January 21, 2015
his team come forward, identify yourselves and explain your project.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Good afternoon, I’m Ron Hinkle of Pinnacle Homes, I’m here representing Lacey
Development tonight who’s plan for the rezoning of the property. As for, to give you a
little background on Pinnacle Homes, if you don’t know already, we’ve been building in
the Henrietta area for over sixteen, eighteen (16-18) years right now. We’ve personally
been building houses for over thirty (30) years. We’ve built the majority of the houses
in the Harvest Hill Subdivision, which is on, between Ward Hill Road and East Henrietta
Road. Of the one hundred and five (105) lots that we had in there, we only have four
(4) lots remaining right now, so that’s why we’ve come before the Board tonight to ask
for rezoning of a forty-six (46) acre parcel adjacent to our Harvest Hill Subdivision
across from Ward Hill Road. Again, as I said before, I’m representing my partner, Jim
Erwin that owns that and Lacey Development. This parcel currently is zoned RR-2 and
we have proposed for RR-1 zoning on it. The difference between the RR-2 and the RR-1
is that the availability of sewers and our concept plan, which we have gone in front of
the Planning Board with, the initial part, is all serviceable by sewers for the whole
project. The larger lots that are required are RR-2, makes the development of this
parcel unfeasible. With the changing to RR-1 and set of zoning allowing forty-five (45)
lots at two thousand (2,000), twenty thousand square foot (20,000 sq. ft.) minimum
lots, this parcel would be comparable to what we have currently across the road at
Harvest Hills Neighborhood, making it much more marketable. So, again tonight we’re
here to present the concept that we’ve taken to the Planning Board already and from
here I’d like to hand it off to my engineers to talk about the more technical part.
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Thanks. Good evening. My name is John Hotto from McMahon LaRue, Engineers and
Surveyors from Webster, New York. As Mr. Hinkle said we’re here to go over our
rezoning application for the forty-five point (45.) or forty-six point five (46.5) acres of
currently RR-2 zoned land to RR-1. The property is located on the south side of Ward
Hill Road between East Henrietta Road and Pinnacle Road. Per Chapter Five (5) of the
Town Code, the Rural Residential district is purposed with supporting creative, lowimpact development patterns and land uses that conserve natural resources and lands,
open lands in the entire area of the Town south of the Thruway, while enhancing the
quality of overall life for the residents. The district has been established to provide and
maintain large, contiguous areas of land to promote and support open space uses,
activities, wildlife habitat and protect important natural resources throughout the
community, and it’s to allow for development at a medium to low density on a range of
lot sizes. The current site has about thirteen (13) acres of heavily wooded land and
brush land found primarily in the southwest corner of the site…

(From audience, Ron Hinkle, Pinnacle Homes, “Forty-six point five (46.5) acre site is
2

TB January 21, 2015

defined by this Town lot line here and north. This is part of the project that I’ll get into
in a minute.”)
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
…so we have thirteen (13) acres of woodlands and brush land found on the site and the
rest of the land is open fields, meadows and agriculturally used land. The predominant
soils are hilt and fine, sandy loams and Ontario loams, which are suitable for
development. We’ve take a comprehensive approach to the rezoning and design of this
Trail View Subdivision. Using the current RR-2 zoning, with a five (5) acre minimum lot
size, we can only create about nine (9) lots on the forty-six point five (46.5) acres site.
That, we cannot, with, to provide sewers and other infrastructural utilities, we can’t
dovetail that with nine (9) acre lots feasibly. The market also is pushing towards more
smaller lots for homeowners. They’re not that interested in larger lots. So then we
looked at the RR-1 zoning and that would require two (2) acre minimum lots and that
still would only create twenty (20) lots on the forty-six (46) acre site, so we’re still
trying to create a balance between, you know, development costs and marketability of
the project and providing affordable homes. To accomplish this goal, the project team
working closely with the Town, would like to apply the RR-1 open space incentive plan
to create smaller lots and subsequently preserve open space and rural character using
the following approach. There’s a sixty-eight point two (68.2) acre…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You have to, can you pick up the microphone so that the recorder, yes, thank you.

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “Yes, and maybe you could turn it around,
people can’t see what you’re talking about on the map.”)
COUNCILMAN PAGE
You can keep turning. We don’t need to see we have a copy here.

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “Can you show us where Ward Hill is?”)
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
…Ward Hill is right here…

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “Thank you.”)
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
…and East Henrietta Road is right here.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
The microphone is wireless so you can just grab that right off of there. There you go.

TB January 21, 2015
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
So our comprehensive approach here is to look at this adjacent property, which is sixtyeight point two, two (68.22) acres owned by Mr. Burns, and what we’ve come up with
is pretty good strategy for providing some affordable housing and also accomplishing
some open space goals. By putting these two (2) parcels together we create a parcel of
one hundred and fourteen point eight (114.8) acres. The acreage of unbuildable,
encumbered wetlands on the Burns property is twenty-six point two seven (26.27) and
the reason I’m talking about these wetlands is I cannot use those as part of the open
space calculation, they are set aside and not part, I can’t use those and say that we’re
providing that as open space. So I have to use available, buildable land that will be set
aside as open space. Using the RR-1, point seven (0.7) units per acre density
calculation, which is in the Code, we would multiply eighty-eight point five three (88.53)
acres times point seven (0.7), that gives us approximately sixty-two (62) units allowed.
So, right now we’re showing forty-five (45) single-family residential lots on the forty-six
(46) acre site, and we have thirty (30) duplex units on this East Henrietta Road site, so
that’s a total of seventy-five (75) single-family residential units. Per the Code, additional
incentives are available to increase unit count, and these are based on and closely
related to the rural development design guidelines of the Town of Henrietta. If the
project provides public access to conservation areas, we can get ten percent (10%)
more units, so that’d be another plus six (+6) units. Another aspect of the incentive
program is to convert open lands to conservation ownership and management by a land
trust, and that would give us five percent (5%) more units, so that’s another three (3)
units. Provision of additional amenities approved by the Planning Board that meet the
objectives of the rural development guidelines can award up to ten percent (10%) more
units and working closely with the Planning Board, we’ve created four (4) additional
units, so we have an additional thirteen (13) units, so that’s how we got seventy-five
(75); sixty-two plus thirteen is seventy-five (62 + 13 = 75) residential units on eightyeight point five three (88.53) buildable acres. In terms of public access, we’re proposing
sidewalks from Ward Hill down to the open space area, which is a heavily wooded,
naturalized area that’s very interesting and ecologically important and we’d like to
provide public access to that. There’s the Lehigh Valley Trail, which divides the Burns
property here, and we understand that’s a very popular trail so we’re going to provide
access to that as well from both areas of the community; the single-family and the
duplex as well. Both parts of the project will be privately owned, no rentals, so they’ll
be, you know, individual residential homes. The other thing we need to consider is the
open space requirement. Per the Code, fifty percent (50%) of open space is required
for this type of calculation, so fifty percent (50%) of eighty-eight point five three
(88.53) acres is forty-four (44) acres, approximately. We’ve provided sixty point five
(60.5) acres of open space on this project site, not including the D.E.C. wetlands that
are outlined on the Burns property in this low point on the south side of the Lehigh
Valley Trail, so we’re in pretty good shape in terms of open space. The developer’s
4

TB January 21, 2015
been working with a land trust, different land trusts, to arrange an ownership taking of
up to eighty-seven (87) acres, which would include the wetlands, so we have sixty point
five (60.5) acres of open space and then we’ll also hand over to them the twenty-six
(26) acres of wetlands. The rural characteristics of the project would be wide lots along
Ward Hill Road, up in here, to provide more buffering. We provided open space
buffering around the north side of some of these residential lots, we’re preserving some
open space here as a meadow, we’re preserving hedge rows here and along the south
side of the Burns property. This site has been designed to reflect the existing
contouring of the property instead of masquerading the whole thing, we’ll retrofit the
design with curvilinear type country roads and also provide more buffering adjacent to
neighbors and, let’s see here, we’ll have some walkout properties over here to minimize
grading as well, depending on the profile; we’re matching the profile of these existing
grades along here to minimize impacts to the area. So the project really fits well with
the site and the project also kind of reflects a hamlet type setting with the smaller lots
and the extensive open space buffering, and is there any questions?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I think maybe we ought to clarify a couple of things first (1st). In 2005 the Town Board
set up this Rural Residential zoning basically to slow down residential developments
south of the Thruway. They actually did a very job, this is the first (1st) proposal the
Town has had since that time, to allow any type of large residential developments south
of the Thruway and as the land becomes less available north of the Thruway, I would
anticipate we’re going to see some more of this, so this is the first time that all of us
have been through this with their mathematical equations and some of the things that
they put forth, I have a problem understanding the math, personally, but I think
hopefully we can clarify that moving forward. I look at, if you have two (2) acres and
you have sewers, two (2) acre lot size, and you want to build fifty (50) homes, well
somehow I would think you would have to have one hundred (100) acres to develop;
two (2) acres per lot. And with the incentives, it seems to be much different than what
I would think when I’m thinking of two (2) acres minimum, and I think that’s where
anybody I’ve talked to about this project, they have a hard time comprehending that,
and maybe you could help clarify it.
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Well, in my mind, if this was developed as two (2) acre sites, we get twenty (20) sites,
no open space will be provided; it’s all private land, it would just be subdivided into
twenty (20), two (2) acre lots. And people don’t really, people don’t want two (2) acre
lots.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And I agree with you totally, they don’t want to take care of that anymore.
5

TB January 21, 2015
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I totally understand that. I tried to sell two (2) acre lots, it doesn’t work, personally. But
if you’re going to develop forty-five (45) homes there, I would think you would have to
have ninety (90) acres to start with somehow.
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
We do. We have one hundred and fourteen point eight (114.8).
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, I know, but you’ve got thirty (30) townhouses, so you have seventy-five (75) total
units, so in my mind if you’re going to provide sewers there, you should have one
hundred and fifty (150) acres total, of which you only have one hundred and fourteen
(114).
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Right, but…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
So, the math doesn’t work for me. But with your incentives it’s supposed to and that’s
where, I think it gets very confusing.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Right, and that’s all a part of the Code.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Oh, I totally understand it’s part of the Code, but I think that for the general public out
here, they’re saying two plus two (2+2) isn’t equaling four (4) here.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And I think we have to do a better job of figuring out as a Board here how we’re going
to explain some of these incentives that were put in the Code in 2005 because now this
is the first (1st) time we’ve seen it, and it’s confusing to everybody, including myself.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Do you guys have some more notes so we can help.
6

TB January 21, 2015
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Just, the extra two (2) that were on the chair there.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
That’s all I needed.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yes, totally agree
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Oh, okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Questions from the Board? I mean you were here Mr. Mulligan in 2005 when this was
adopted and I think that I didn’t agree with it because I was, at the time…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
You were trying to sell…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…I was trying…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
…land.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…right. So I thought you took money out of my pocket.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
We absolutely did.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yes.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But in the same token, it actually did what it was intended to do, and that was to
preserve open space in some manner without purchasing development rights. Because
I don’t believe the Town Board felt that residents wanted to pay the kind of money that
the Town of Pittsford did for development rights, so they came up with a way that they
could do that and maintain the rural character of our Town, and they’ve done a great
job of it, but now we’re going to start to see some of this. The cluster type of
development that you’re doing here, which is, they call it a two-seventy-eight (278),
7

TB January 21, 2015
where you can go down to a fifteen thousand square foot (15,000 sq. ft.) lot, works
economically for everybody. It works for the developer because he has less
infrastructure to put in, so there’s less sewer, there’s less water, there’s less roads. It
works for the Town also because the Town doesn’t have to maintain all of those
amenities spread over the hundred and fourteen (114) acres, it’s clustered in one
corner. And then it allows the general public to then enjoy the eighty-six (86) acres of
open space that the Genesee Land Trust takes or somebody else, as kind of like the
offshoot of allowing them to cluster, and it’s the way I think the Town Board intended it
to work, so that we could preserve open space moving forward, keep the rural
character of our Town, but still not tell people we don’t want any more residents in the
Town of Henrietta. So I think it’s accomplishing it, but the math is confusing, so I think
we as a Board, because this is the first (1st) time we’ve seen it since 2005, we may
have to go back and look at a simpler way of redefining this Code so that everybody
can comprehend it easier.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Okay. Do you want a copy, or would you like a copy of…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Oh no, I have…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
We have it.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…it.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
No, we have it.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
This is…
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Oh, okay, I’m sorry.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…this is nothing foreign to you Ron, we’ve talked about…
8

TB January 21, 2015
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Yes.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…I don’t see where the math works.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay?
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
If you’re going to do seventy-five (75) homes, there should be one hundred and fifty
(150) acres there somehow.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
John, through you Mr. Supervisor, this is a very upscale area, you know, you’ve got
homes in the two hundred and fifty thousand ($250,000.00), three hundred thousand
($300,000.00) range. I have a major problem with these duplexes. I think that’s a
mistake on the part of the developer, I don’t think the residents would want that.
You’re getting a lot of homes here on a small piece of land, and I understand the
economics of it, but I personally will not support the duplexes.

(Applause)
JOHN HOTTO, R.L.A., MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Well, they are going to be high end duplexes, I mean, and there are a lot of senior
people that are interested in…
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Can I say something? Al LaRue, McMahon Larue Associates. The duplexes are on the
parcel that’s already zoned RR-1 and in that, that’s just a clustering under Town Law §
9

TB January 21, 2015
278, to cluster down on a difficult parcel topographically in order to make that
development work, that’s what we’re doing there. We’re not asking the Town Board to
rezone that parcel, we’re only asking for a rezoning on the sort-of spot zoning on the
Ward Hill side. On the Ward Hill side, north, west and south, they’re all zoned RR-1
where this parcel’s really zoned RR-2, so that’s what…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
And I think we’re…
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
…we’re…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
…giving you a lot with the smaller lots. I think the Board is bending over backwards,
but I think there’s an element of greed going into these duplexes because that’s
nothing but generating a ton of revenue. That’s my read on it. You differ with it, that’s
your opinion.
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Yes, we do and that’s a, there’s a high development cost for that parcel because of the
topographic features, so there was another proposal for single-family homes here that
just didn’t work and it failed as a result of that. So the single-family homes there’s just
way too much earth work involved to put those in, so the community, the clustering,
the duplexes really solves that problem and creates a way to develop that parcel that’s
economically feasible.

(From audience, Ron Hinkle, Pinnacle Homes, “If I could also, if I could pass just show
you what the duplexes will look like…”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
The other thing I think that the Town Board in 2005 didn’t do probably as well as we
probably need to going forward is, I don’t see a difference between RR-1 and RR-2,
only that if you had sewers, you were permitted to build on two (2) acres verses if you
didn’t have sewers, you had to have five (5) acres minimum, so I don’t really think
there should be a rezone. I think if sewers are accessible, you could build on two (2)
acre minimum verses five (5) acres if you didn’t, and I think that’s something else we
have to clean up in what we’re doing here.
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Yes, that’s really not the way the Code reads right now but I understand what you’re
saying.
10

TB January 21, 2015
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes, because to me there is no rezoning here, it’s a Rural Residential type setting and
you have to either have two (2) acres minimum or five (5) acres and we have to figure
out whether you’re going to have sewers or not…
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Yes, we do…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…and if you cluster them, it financially works for everybody and there’s a lot more open
space preserved, whereas nobody wants five (5) acres to take care of today…
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Or even two (2), right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…they don’t take care of it, it becomes a weed patch, the back part of it anyways.
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Right, right exactly.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Through you, Mr. Supervisor, can I just ask, kind of taking a different direction…
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Sure.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…who’s your target market for this, for these types of homes?
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
For the duplexes?
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yes.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
It’d be empty nesters, more so empty nesters would be the market for this. We’re
seeing it in a lot of the adjoining Towns around Webster, Perrinton and right now it’s a
very hot market, is the duplexes. We’re able to, it’s a bit of a savings over a standard,
but as you can see on the rendering that I’ve given you, these are not apartment
houses. They’re, they look like single-family houses, high end single-family houses that
11

TB January 21, 2015
will blend into the neighborhood unlike the apartments that are already down the road
within a hands throw of this. We are doing a much higher end product and to counter
what you’re saying that it is a revenue maker, we have to make revenue on this to
make this work, this is the only way. We’ve had that property now across the road for
quite some years and when you rezoned it back in whatever year, again, you took away
a lot that, you made it unfeasible to develop and with the Codes that you have in your
Town Codes, we’re staying right to that we’re not going out asking for any special,
anything special on it, the numbers that are in your Codes, and it’s in that packet that
we’ve given you. We meet the minimum, and we sat down with Peter and with Chris
already and there was a couple discrepancies on some of the incentives and we agreed
to that and we’re down to the seventy-five (75) lots for the two (2) parcels, so once
again, this is, I think our track record speaks for itself across the road in Harvest Hills, it
is a high end neighborhood, you said that. We’re not going to do anything different we
wouldn’t want to do anything different because if I felt that the duplexes were going to
take away from this project, I’d be shooting myself in the foot, I don’t think that’s the
case. You can see that those duplexes are higher end than I’m going to say, sixty
percent (60%) of the houses in Henrietta, so we are not bringing in a low end product
for that, so…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
So, what’s the price point you anticipate selling these for?
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
The duplexes around two-fifty, two-sixty ($250,000.00 - $260,000.00), right around
there.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Does the project work without the duplexes?
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
It does not, and again, the project before this was, that was proposed here was a
single-family lot project and it didn’t go through with the previous builder that tried to
do that feasibility wise, and if we went to a single-family on this, it wouldn’t, it still
wouldn’t work because we’ve got forty-five (45) lots that we’re doing single-family on
the Ward Hill Road side. To do more single-family on this parcel, it would be another,
you know we can only absorb so many houses sales in a year’s time. The forty-five (45)
lots on the other side, you know, are going to be probably an eight (8) year, eight to
ten (8-10) year sellout for that, at the least. So if we did single-family over on the other
side, it would be that many more years before we get to it, and as you know, when we
get this approved, we’re paying for the property tax on these parcels from the get-go
and we get approval and that carrying cost for financing and everything else would
absolutely not make it feasible. So we need a different product and we have seen from
12

TB January 21, 2015
other townships that the duplexes are a very popular product right now, so that’s why
we’re saying that the two (2) parcels will complement each other, it will not take away
from it.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Alright with, so you’re anticipating thirty (30) duplexes, how many cars do you
anticipate coming out on East Henrietta Road from that area? Are you anticipating like
two (2), two (2) at…
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Two (2) at the most.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…two (2) cars a, and that’s a tough road to come out on, so that’s why I’m wondering
where exactly you will come out on East Henrietta Road.
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
And we’ve provided, previously we’ve provided a letter from our traffic consultant that it
explained all that, and I don’t know that I have it handy here, maybe I do…(pause,
leafing through papers)…that was a part of our initial discussions with Town staff and I
don’t think I have it, do you have it John?

(From audience, John Hotto, R.L.A., McMahon LaRue Associates, “No.”)
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
But we did provide a traffic letter from our traffic consultant and the levels of service
were well under what’s allowable or what’s prudent for that, both intersections actually,
the Ward Hill side and the East Henrietta side. As far as site distance is concerned…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Right.
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
…we have double the required site distance on both intersections, so that’s not an
issue. So traffic really isn’t an issue on this, it’s well within norms.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Okay. Thank you.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
One of the things that I consider when we’re looking at projects, is what is the visual
impact to neighboring residential areas and on the side where the duplexes are, is really
13

TB January 21, 2015
off of East Henrietta Road, I’m not sure you could even notice them if you were driving
by…
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
You wouldn’t.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
…I mean it’s screen by vegetation, there’s really no other residential impact to it except
maybe a house that maybe Doctor Burns owned before and I think his family still owns
and again, I just wanted you to know with the duplex situation, I don’t think there’s
going to be any impact visually, traffic wise, or anything to the existing people that live
in that area. There’s two (2) separate sides and the duplex side is really almost
screened, I don’t think you can even see it. The other thing that you mentioned,
something about not renting, and that they’re private dedicated roads to, is there a
Home Owner’s Association?
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
No.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
There’s not, okay.
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Land trust of some sort, will handle all the open space.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Okay. So one of the things that I was going to suggest, and I do in ever proposed
project that comes along with a Home Owner’s Association, is that they write in in the
Home Owner’s Association Agreement that rentals are not permitted under any
condition unless it’s to immediate family, and that’s what I was going to suggest, but…
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
That can be in the deed too.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yes.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Yes…
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Restriction in the deed.
14

TB January 21, 2015
COUNCILMAN PAGE
…It would be a strong…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
It would be very…
COUNCILMAN PAGE
…plus…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…important.
RON HINKLE, PINNACLE HOMES
Absolutely.
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Yes.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
…for some of the things we’re dealing with in our community.
AL LARUE, L.S., VICE-PRESIDENT, MCMAHON LARUE ASSOCIATES
Absolutely. As far as the visual impact of the Town, of the duplexes, we’re already
providing a screen from the first two (2) units (cough), excuse me, for the houses out
on West, East Henrietta Road.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is there anybody else on the Board that has any additional questions? (Pause, no

CHARLES LOOKUP, 49 WARD HILL ROAD
My name is Charles Lookup, 49 Ward Hill Road, approximately two hundred feet (200’)
from my east property line to the developer’s west property line. I’m on the west side of
the hill. I’ve been there for thirty (30) years, believe it or not. As far as maintaining five
(5) acres of property, I mow mine, entirely, including taking care of some fish, and I
think most everybody knows where I live now. I guess where I come from is that back
in 2005, us, many of us, took a lot of time with the Town to establish where high
density verses low density should fall, excuse me for my gasping for air, but I have
C.O.P.D., bottom line is two (2) acres to five (5) acres has been the knowledgeable side
of things and Ward Hill, basically in the last few years, has been all built that way. Sure
there’s been homes that are, were built prior to 2005 that are a smaller acreage. I think
where I come from is that they just put a sewer district in that area, but it’s all in
pumping, it’s all pump, it’s not gravity, number one (1), or as far as I know, and
number one (1) is that this new development would tax the living daylights out of what
we’ve got now. Number two (2) is, the density issue on Ward Hill is very serious. Ward
Hill is basically a blind road. At the top of the hill you can’t see the other side at all,
particularly any development on the south side of the road, you have a real visibility site
distance issue. The reason why I talk this way is because I’m a developer; I develop
land in Henrietta and when I bought the land in Henrietta, I knew what I had to build
and what I was zoning to work with, and I think that maybe something’s been missed
the boat or at least I’m hoping that’s the story that they did this, the new developer did
not know what he was buying. Thank you.

(Applause)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
The next speaker, Ann Stevens.
ANN STEVENS, 6373 EAST RIVER ROAD
Hi. I’m Ann Stevens, I’m at 6373 East River Road. I’ve reviewed this project and just
have a couple of items that seem to need a little clarification or review. In the additional
incentives section in E(1)(a) of the “Open Space Incentive Option” in the Town Code, it
states that an additional six (6) units or the ten percent (10%) bonus can be added,
quote, “If there’s a linking of open space or trail corridors through the site with existing
or proposed trails or open space networks. To qualify, the general public must have
regular opportunity for access to and use of at least ten percent (10%) of the
conservation area for pedestrian purposes.” I haven’t seen and I still don’t see any trails
in the open space that would link the subdivisions to the Lehigh Valley Trail. I’m
wondering also where the public is going to park in order to get to the conserved land.
Secondly, the “Additional Amenities Bonus,” in section E(1)(e) of the “Open Space
Incentive Option,” it states that the Planning Board can award another ten percent
16

TB January 21, 2015
(10%) bonus or another six (6) units if quote, “Additional amenities are provided by the
project applicant that meet the goals and objectives of this section and the Rural
Development Design Guidelines,” unquote. The developer’s listed five (5) items under
the heading, “Additional Amenities.” Items number four and five (4, 5) both speak to
protecting the scenic viewsheds on, along the roadside and surrounding landscape, but
if you were to drive on Ward Hill Road and look and imagine this subdivision there,
you’d see a subdivision, you wouldn’t see any scenic viewshed at all. You wouldn’t have
any sense that there was open space behind that subdivision, so I would say two (2)
out of those five (5) items are not really valid as being considered additional amenities.
And the fact that there is no trails noted, those could be additional amenities if they
were nice trails that were stone dust, bridges over the wetlands, overlooks, something
like that, but that’s not listed in the plan either. And finally, it looks to me like the
neighboring parcel to the east of this, and I’m not sure if this is true or not, but it could
be landlocked if this subdivision goes in, so I’m not seeing any knockouts for potential
connectivity from this subdivision into the east parcel and didn’t know if the Planning
Board had taken that into account, just worrying about landlocked parcels, so, that’s it.
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thanks, Ann. Mr. Faggiano.

(Applause)
VINCENT FAGGIANO, 2109 PINNACLE ROAD
My name is Vincent Faggiano, I live at 2109 Pinnacle Road. I’m here with other
residents to urge the Board to stand by the current zoning regulations for areas south
of the Thruway. In 2005 this Board showed the vision and adopted regulations to
maintain the integrity of this area of our Town; an area where I’ve lived for forty (40)
years. It was a lure of rural living in such close proximity to a central services that
caused me to buy my initial home, and then subsequently build a new home on the
property. Over the years many additional homes have been built in the area. Those
homes built met the building restrictions and codes at the expense of the homeowner
and/or the builder and maintained the character of our area. Some forty (40) years ago,
Henrietta was the joke of Monroe County. Whenever somebody wanted to define
uncontrolled, overpopulated and unregulated building, the saying was, “We don’t want
another Henrietta.” I truly hope this Board isn’t prepared to move back to those days.
During the time I lived in Town, great expansion in residential, commercial and
industrial areas has occurred. With that expansion created great increase in the tax
base for our Town, unlike those communities suffering from financial distress. It was
not so long ago that the Town stood against the location of a casino in our community;
a project which properly planned would have had minimal negative impact on our
community but a great positive financial impact. A project other communities in Monroe
17

TB January 21, 2015
County would have welcomed with open arms, in spite of the great “No More Casino”
movement, which was really generated by other casinos to eliminate competition. Now
we’re considering building homes on one third (1/3) acre lots in violation of current
building restrictions. This type of cluster housing may be convenient for the builder, but
not for the residents of the area. Leaving open space on land which cannot be built
upon is no answer to maintaining the character of our area. Who would benefit from
this? The residents of the area? No. The ailing tax base? We don’t have one, so that’s
not a problem. Property values in the area? No. Simply put, it would only benefit the
developer. Is he a Town resident with lifelong commitment to the area? I don’t think so.
During a recent road construction, reconstruction on Pinnacle Road we saw firsthand
the short sightedness of planners. Large amounts of storm runoff was redirected to
private property. Promises to ensure the flow of these waters and minimizing the
impact on the land owners in the area, were soon abandoned. By the way, this is the
same area downhill and the same area gravity would direct storm runoff from this
project to. The land owners in this area will not stand still to having their properties
flooded and will take the necessary steps to prevent the runoff from passing through
their private properties. Water pressure in the area will further be negatively impacted
with the addition of this many homes, and no one has presented a plan to increase
water capacity to the area. Is the developer ready and prepared to pay for this?

(Bell ring)
VINCENT FAGGIANO, 2109 PINNACLE ROAD
The idea of waiving, add twenty (20) minutes so I can go a little bit over, the idea of
waiving current restrictions may appealing to those in the Town who own large parcels
of land and absentee land owners who may want to sell them off to developers for
great profits, but it is unacceptable to the residents who live in the area. It would also
create a legal practice which would be grounds for future appeals to waive zoning
restrictions in the area. I would hope this Board isn’t about giving people a chance to
speak out and then ignoring the message they have. If our message falls on deaf ears
in this issue, rest assured it will be raised again in the future. Please don’t lose sight
that serving on this Board makes you accountable to and representative of the
residents of this area who will be impacted by your decision. I hope this Board has the
courage to stand by current zoning restrictions for the area. Let’s not return to the days
of, “We don’t want another Henrietta.” Thank you.

RAYMOND HAWKINS, 105 BRANCHBROOK DRIVE
Yes, my name is Raymond Hawkins, I live on 105 Branchbrook. I know when I come up
Branchbrook to make a right or left on Ward Hill, it’s very hard to pull out there. A lot of
times you can’t see very well; there’s shrubs, there’s trees, there’s traffic coming over
the hill. Now we’ll be having another street across from you with traffic coming through
to you, it’s going to be a lot harder, a lot more traffic and the other thing they’re going
to do is come straight through, down Branchbrook Road to East Henrietta. Now we
have all the traffic flow from this project coming through Branchbrook without any
control and some of the people that come down Branchbrook now don’t really come
down too slow and it’s a curvy street. I’m really worried about the traffic. Thank you.

DAN DIXON, 240 WARD HILL ROAD
Hi, my name is Dan Dixon, I live at 240 Ward Hill Road. I have a little experience with
the Codes that were enacted in 2005. It held up my site plan; I live on the bottom of
Ward Hill where all their runoff’s going to go to on the bottom…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
One of the five (5) acres.
DAN DIXON, 240 WARD HILL ROAD
Yes, I have one (1) of those five (5) acre lots…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
The only lots that were developed since 2005 were all five (5) acre lots right there all
on the north side of Ward Hill Road…

(From audience, unidentified person, “And were not needed.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…south of the Thruway.
DAN DIXON, 240 WARD HILL ROAD
And not what? I did notice that they didn’t have any problems selling them. They went
pretty quick, so I don’t know what the problem with two (2) acre lots is. I do know that
19

TB January 21, 2015
I have water problems now that I’m dealing with and I have, I replaced my sump pump
pretty regularly just to keep up, which I, it’s the land, it’s, you know, I knew that going
into it, but now there’s going to be a ton more water over that way, no matter what
they do, we already have tons of water problems on Ward Hill Road, we’re going to
have more. I went by the five (5) acre rule, I have a septic and I had to have five (5)
acres and I had five (5) acres and I built my house and I did it so I could afford it, I
built it myself, I’m a general contractor, and if you’re going to have the land, you look
at the Codes, two (2) acres per house, you can get a nice price house in there, and it
seems like the only reason that I hear that they want to change the zoning, the only
reason I hear is, “It’s not feasible any other way.” Well, then it’s simply not feasible,
move on, or do the two (2) acre lots.

(Applause)
DAN DIXON, 240 WARD HILL ROAD
I don’t think the Town Board should change something just because the developer can’t
make enough money on a development. If it, you know, they should have done their
numbers in the beginning, I know the zoning changes, I deal with Code changes all the
time, and I had my own business for twenty-five (25) years, you have to, changes
happen. So, I’m, I was comfortable with the five (5) acres and the two (2) acres, I
abided by it, and I like to see you guys have other developers go by the two (2) acre
rule too. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
Karen Wolgast, and I apologize if I mispronounced your name.
KAREN WOLGAST, 231 WARD HILL ROAD
That’s alright. Karen Wolgast, I live at 231 Ward Hill Road, so I’m directly at the bottom
of the hill on the same side as the proposed development, and my concern is, we have
such a high problem with just water runoff just as it is just from rain, increasing this
frightens me for what I’m going to be dealing with in my basement that we’ve had to
replace sump pumps, we’ve had to put French drain, I mean my back yard is French
drained, luckily grass was growing on top of it, that’s it. My bigger concern is the traffic.
I have three (3) children, I have an eight (8) year old that can’t even go out and check
the mail; forty miles an hour (40 mph) is too fast. That means people are going fifty to
fifty-five miles an hour (50-55 mph) up my street. My children have to wait for the bus
in the dark to go to the high school, it’s not safe for them to do so, and now you’re
20

TB January 21, 2015
asking at least one hundred (100) more cars to go up and down my street. Because
right now with Branchbrook the way it is, people can get in off of East Henrietta Road
or Ward Hill, the only access is off of Ward Hill, so people, one hundred (100) more
cars a day are going to be going past my home at speeds that are already too fast, so I
have to say that if development is going to happen it’s going to happen, I’m particularly
pleased that it will be this developer versus a Ryan or a Faber Homes that builds them
on top of each other like in West Henrietta, but I’m very concerned about the speed
and I’m very concerned about the water.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
Paul Biehler.
PAUL BIEHLER, 2143 PINNACLE ROAD
Hi, my name’s Paul Biehler, I live on 2143 Pinnacle Road right at the Rush and
Henrietta border, and my background is engineering, construction, development and
such, and what I know about this, I mean personally I look at a third (1/3) of an acre
for a house and it, you just, I moved out to the country to have some space look
behind me, I don’t want to see a city development. I don’t think anybody’s against
having a house on two (2) acres or five (5) acres because it gives you enough space
there, but what I can tell you as an engineer is that runoff is going to happen because
now you’re taking away valuable soil, you’ve got more roof space, more driveway, more
parking lot, the water’s going to go someplace and it’s going to go downhill. Sewers,
again, it was mentioned before, they go uphill, that’s going to cause problems, I
guarantee in ten (10) years there’s going some problem. I know right now because I’ve
been sort of involved over the years on other things, you know one (1) of the houses
on Ward Hill I did some work on, and water pressure is a big issue. Right now we’re
pretty fortunate and I know a lot of people in the Water Authority and that many
houses in the morning when you’re going to take a shower, it’s going to be like
somebody flushed the toilet, turned on the sink and you’re going to get a trickle, and
right now I have some nice water pressure and it makes for a good shower, you know,
if I’m doing it in the middle of the day and I sleep in, which doesn’t happen, it’s really
good. That’s going to change. Now the developer bought that parcel there, and I’m, I
know these gentlemen from way back when, and they just had the farmland, now I’m
not so familiar what happened here with Doctor Burns’ property, if they purchase it, if
it’s contingent on whatever, but they knew what they were getting into on that
farmland and to change it and I know that all of Burns’ land is wooded and wet. There’s
also some wet areas and this and that, and what they’re considering, they’d give you
21

TB January 21, 2015
green space off their property. If it’s wetlands, you’ve got to be one hundred and fifty
feet (150’) from that, so they’re kind of giving you some dry land which they couldn’t
build on anyways. My concern also is, I mean once that development, I mean, I
understand a builder wants to make money, but I don’t see the benefit for the Town’s
people at all, I mean every person that has a house there is going to pay taxes, so
having a bigger development or shorter development, there’s still, they’re paying to
have it maintained; the Town’s not losing money, something like this they might have a
little extra money to spend on something, another employee or truck, but that backs,
that on the east side, on its east side goes to Moore farm land…

(Bell ring)
PAUL BIEHLER, 2143 PINNACLE ROAD
…and that’s just going to open up Pandora’s box, so when you allow that, it’s going to
allow it to change on the other one and keep on going and keep on going, and
everybody around there likes their view and their backyard, their four or five (4-5) acres
right now, and everybody does take care of it. Maybe when you’re eighty (80) years old
you don’t, but right now we do. Thank you.

Marty Miller.
MARTY MILLER, 109 WARD HILL ROAD
I’m Marty Miller, I live at 109 Ward Hill Road. I have multiple concerns. I’ve got a lot of
different misgivings about this, I mean one (1) of the reasons why it’s going right in my
backyard…(inaudible, away from microphone)…here and when my house was built, one
of the things they built onto it was a really nice back deck, and I left the Town of Chili a
few years ago to move to Henrietta because, multiple reasons, I work in Henrietta, a
lifelong resident of Rush, and now back to Henrietta again, my family lives in Rush, I
have family in Henrietta that’s been there over one hundred (100) years, so as a
lifelong resident I would like to return to the area and one of the things my grandfather
used to say was, “Invest in land, they don’t make it anymore.” This to me is not a great
investment. I’m with Karen, I have young children; I have a four (4) year old and a four
(4) month old, they can’t play in the front yard, I agree with Karen on that too, but now
they won’t be able to play in the backyard without looking in somebody else’s window
and, like I said, there’s a reason I got away from that, I moved from Chili from a cluster
development, I lived there for eleven (11) years, so multiple misgivings. The traffic, I
22

TB January 21, 2015
agree with that. My other capacity, other than a teacher is a farmer; I move farm
equipment up and down Ward Hill Road. To see additional fifty to one hundred (50100) cars coming down that road, scares the hell out of me, honestly, alright because if
you’ve got a tractor or a combine or something like that and somebody’s upset behind
you or, it really is a blind road in a lot of senses, you really can’t see, and the majority
of the cars right now that are speeding down Ward Hill do end up turning into
Branchbrook, alright so you’re just going to compound or multiply that problem in this
case. Drainage, I agree with that as problematic. There’s slope on just about every part
of this parcel, save maybe for the extreme eastern part, and that does actually have a
southern slope, and one (1) of the proposals that they had was to have the sewer run
to the north. I don’t know how you’re going to make water run up hill without a
pumping station, and according to the last Meeting I went to, the proposal on that was
it was going to be gravity fed, which means that the south end of the property, it’s
going to be very shallow and subject to freezing in the winter and it will be, the pit
would be very deep where it crosses under Ward Hill Road, alright, so I had an issue
with that. Particularly behind my property I asked about fill earlier and they said, “Well
we wouldn’t put fill behind your house.” Well, if you’re going to level the lots out
directly out my window to the south you’re probably looking at, from the woods to my
house, easily a fifty foot (50’) drop, if not an eighty foot (80’) drop, alright, so there’s
quite a slope to negotiate there, so unless they’re actually going to build the lots into
the hill and follow the slope of the hill in that case, I’m not sure how they’re really going
to compensate for the runoff, so those are my issues on where this stands. Thanks.

Hi. Ron built my house and it’s beautiful and I love it, but I just have some concerns

townhouses?

SUPERVISOR MOORE
The duplex is townhouses.
TRACEY BLATTER, 222 BRANCHBROOK DRIVE
Okay, that’s, alright, that’s where the clarification comes in, and I guess I’m just kind
of, you know, I’m not going to waste time I, everything that everybody said is a
concern of mine, the school district is exploding and that whole thing is trying to be
revamped, it’s just a lot of concerns for parents with kids, just more and more people
moving in and taking different zoning for schools. I know a lot of people live where we
live because they wanted their children to go to Leary like I attended Leary, and that’s
all changing coming up if that passes, so more residents are going to impact that as
well. And also, the duplex, wonderful for senior living and that sort of thing, very
concerned about different kind of, like renting, if they could put in a thing, but also just
that continuing all over Henrietta once that door opens to just continue is a concern for
me too, so thank you.

MICHAEL GUDONIS, 207 WARD HILL ROAD
Yes. Sorry. Big complaint I have is because of the water flow, but there’s an easement
or whatever you want to call it, like a drainage ditch in between the two (2) properties
and it has been neglected for years and years and it just, you get a waterfall down the
hill. It floods, it gets into our basement, it runs across there, you know they said they
may or may not take care of it and then the other thing I was curious is to, you know,
is it possible for them to put a sewer to our property or the rest of the community
properties and also put a pumping station in, if this is going to go forward, because
some of us might like to be on the sewer as well. I guess that’s all I’ve got to say.

Kathleen Rydelek, 65 Hill Terrace, I’m off Ward Hill. Our concern, the reason we’re here
tonight is Ward Hill, that hill is a blind hill and to bring this many cars up or down that
hill is incredibly concerning and what Karen said, Branchbrook, you can get out both
ways. There’s no way out but one (1), and that’s up or down that hill. It’s very
dangerous, people do speed and, but the speeding aside, that’s too many cars on that
road, and the only way you could do something, maybe widen it, but that’s all private
property, so there’s nothing, no way to fix that problem, so that’s our concern and
that’s why we’re here tonight. Thank you.

(Applause)
LARRY BEAN, 4624 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Larry Bean, 4624 East Henrietta Road. For all those people that lived in the RR-1
Districts and I see a lot, or I shouldn’t say, there’s a lot of people that wanted to move
into our district, they’d do anything to move into that, because of the homes, the
regulations that the Town has put on that for the people. Okay, the drainage, we’ve
talked already, I’ve talked to the Town about it. It is horrendous and its showing up
more and more now that, more than we realize even the houses on Ward Hill Road are
having drainage problems. If they don’t correct that pretty soon, they just redid the
drainage on Pinnacle Road, they put it all into one (1) little area that’s got a brand new,
26

TB January 21, 2015
within the last twenty (20) years, ditch or a bridge over the ditch and it has to probably
be six inches (6”) of water going across it. It is built too high, they can’t even dig the
ditches down because the bridge is stopping it. So what happens? We’re starting to
flood and this is all backing up, and I’ve talked with the people to be, and with us, our
Town has been doing something, but the County is not, the County is just dragging
their feet and we can’t force Rush to clean the ditches…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But we’re working on that.
LARRY BEAN, 4624 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
…well…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I understand…
LARRY BEAN, 4624 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
…I know you are.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…I think we have a plan for that. We’re going…
LARRY BEAN, 4624 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…to talk to some…
LARRY BEAN, 4624 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Another thing is, we want to keep the houses up there beautiful, we want to keep the
homes the way they are now, that’s why we live up in that area. Another, just a minor
thing that ticked me off is that sign in the front of the property. That sign told me that
they were going to build houses in there like that sign showed. That sign should have
been on the opposite side of the road on Branchbrook. If anybody driving down the
road, and this mentioned to me, so many people have gone down that street and said,
“Oh they’re going to have beautiful homes,” they’re not going to go to the Meeting.
That isn’t the way it was. They took that sign that should have been on the opposite
side of the street, and we would have a lot more people here tonight. That’s all I’ve got
to say.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thanks, Larry.

KRISTY GRAVES, 30/31 WOODRIDGE TRAIL
Kristy Graves, I own thirty (30) and thirty-one (31) Woodridge Trail, the townhouse
neighborhood. I own a three (3) story townhouse and I did buy because I love the
wooded area of Woodridge Trail, and my second (2nd) floor bedrooms are going to look
directly into these people’s houses, the way the gradient goes, so I am concerned about
that, and I’m not sure the developer has talked about appropriate trees, foliage kind of
saving those of us from that, so I am really worried about that, and the whole
neighborhood is so wet, so I really do think folks have really addressed good concerns
there. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you.

(Applause)
JANE WILSON, 2149 PINNACLE ROAD
Good evening. Jane Wilson, 2149 Pinnacle Road. I just want to address what I’ve heard
repeatedly; “No one wants a two (2) acre lot.” I so, if you go on the Nothnagle site,
people strive, especially younger people, to have a larger lot. We don’t want to be
sitting on top of the other person. In our area, homes, we had Eric’s home, sold way
above what he should have got. I mean like twenty thousand ($20,000.00) over
because of his lot, because of the size of the lot. So don’t tell me people don’t want to
mow. Not at all. That’s why you go to this area, that’s why you did five (5) acre lots.
You can sell those easily, so I think that is an incredibly weak point that you can’t, that
nobody wants to mow it. And I think the drainage where, I feel like I’m almost beating
a dead horse, it’s kind of like the elephant in the middle of the road, in the middle of
the room, it’s like, “Yep, gonna, gonna.” If it’s got no place to go, whatever you do, it
doesn’t do, it isn’t going anywhere, and it’s only going to get worse. Thank you very
much for your time. Have a good day.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thanks.

RAY FEASEL, 280 WARD HILL ROAD
Ray Feasel, 280 Ward Hill Road. I love my five (5) acre lot, I think my property will be
28

TB January 21, 2015
valuable someday because of it. I think you’re crazy to consider putting houses in
shoestring little lots. I’m in a little bit of a delicate position here because I think of
Doctor Burns as a good, personal friend, and I hate to see his deal being queered by
this, but to me it’s real simple. Two (2) acres per house. People will love it, you’ll sell
them in the future, it will be a nice neighborhood, it won’t be more of the Henrietta that
has this terrible reputation. That’s it.

(Applause)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I’d like to go ahead and close this Public Hearing, can I have a motion to do that?
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
So moved.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Second.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. Thanks everybody for coming tonight. This isn’t a decision that I think the
Town Board’s going to make any time soon. There will be a full SEQRA that has to be,
could you speak on that Don, at all, about the SEQRA process for this?
DONALD A. YOUNG, TOWN ATTORNEY
Sure. Before the Town, thank you, before the Town could move forward with anything
on this, including the rezone, before it could move forward with site plan approval or
any Special Use Permits, or anything like that, that might be needed, it would need to
first complete the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) process, which
ensures that environmental review is properly undertaken, so the Board at this point is
not ready to act, even on the rezone portion of this project. It still needs to complete
the full, we call it the SEQRA review, and after, only after that is completed could they
move forward with any other approvals.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And that process takes how long?
DONALD A. YOUNG, TOWN ATTORNEY
It depends on the project, but it could take a substantial amount of time.

(From audience, Vincent Faggiano, 2109 Pinnacle Road, “Question, is that approval
process a public one?”)

to make a decision, it will be put on the Agenda and that you’ll know by going to our
website or a Legal Notice and we’ll have signage on the property like we have had, but
I really do appreciate everybody coming out tonight. We’ll adjourn for five (5) minutes,

COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Just under discussion, at the end of the year, could we have a summation of what this
cost is compared to what we’ve been doing for many years?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Absolutely. This really has come about because of the Comptroller’s audit that we
received in January and we’ve gone from having the type of service we had before with
the contracted employee type situation to consultants and most of it’s a pass through to
the developers, so there really isn’t a net cost to the Town, but I think that we’ll have to
review this at the end of the year along with Mr. Martin’s recommendations as to what
to do going forward.

RESOLUTION #3-72/2015
On Motion of

Seconded by
Councilman Mulligan

WHEREAS, over the past several years, the Town of Henrietta undertook to
comprehensively review the Henrietta Town Code and revise where needed. The origin
of this undertaking was the confirmation by the Henrietta Town Board that the
Henrietta Town Code had been long overdue for such a review, such that, in
consideration of the changes in the Town itself, NY Law, and society over a number of
years, many of the Code’s provisions were likely outdated, inaccurate,
internally/externally inconsistent, etc., and further the Code was likely wholly lacking
certain provisions which should otherwise be present, and
WHEREAS, after review, the Henrietta Town Board called for a comprehensive
revision and update, or “recodification” of the Henrietta Town Code. This process
involved over four (4) years of work by Town officials, Town staff, Town consultants,
and the Town residents. The culmination of work is this proposed Local Law to recodify
the Henrietta Town Code, which aims to bring the Henrietta Town Code up to date, and
WHEREAS, the Attorney for the Town has submitted a draft Local Law to the
Town Board which would, in accordance with the NY Municipal Home Rule Law,
recodify the Henrietta Town Code, including those Local Laws, Ordinances and
Resolutions which comprise it, wherein certain provisions thereof will be updated,
modified, revised and/or repealed; and
WHEREAS, said draft Local Law is on file with the Town Clerk, and is also

SUPERVISOR MOORE
Under discussion, there’s three (3) people here that need to be thanked for getting to
the Resolution of this, and it’s Councilman Page and Deputy Supervisor Minotti for
chairing this committee over the past six (6) years, and also to our Town Attorney for
reviewing it and helping us get to the point where we’re at, that we can finally come to
a closure, sometime hopefully in early March.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
You could have had five (5) babies by now, that’s how long that took.

(Laughter)
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
We should have hired…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Just wanted to point that out.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
…Young a long time ago. We’ve been on this for four (4) years, we hired Young, it’s
done in three (3) months.

(Laughter)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes. It’s not that easy, but…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
It’s been more than four (4) years, hasn’t it?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…please call the roll.
