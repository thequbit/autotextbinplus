Under discussion, the seven point eight million ($7,800,000.00), is that a check like to
the Fire District?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Absolutely and then the “Exhibit A,” included in there is a three hundred and fifty
thousand dollar ($350,000.00) check to the Ambulance, so that’s why it’s a little bit
more than what we spend on a bimonthly basis. Any other questions? Please call the

they coming back to finish that, because I remember they did a lot of work there last
year.

work on the laterals last year, Bill, and this is actually on some main repair.”)

Thank you.

Just briefly, why is the one six (6) wheeler fifty grand ($50,000.00) and the other one’s
a hundred and twenty seven ($127,000.00)?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well because this is the truck and the prior was the equipment, the plow equipment
and the stainless steel box that goes on this truck.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
That’s why they’re from two (2) different places.

We no longer have an “Acting.”
REBECCA WIESNER, TOWN CLERK AND RECEIVER OF TAXES
I believe that’s Tim’s title; he’s an “Acting Director of Parks and Facilities.”
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay. We’ll have to work that one out.
REBECCA WIESNER, TOWN CLERK AND RECEIVER OF TAXES
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Actually, Parks now is under Recreation. We’ll work on that one.

TB February 18, 2015
WHEREAS, Lake Pamela is in substantial disrepair, in that, in addition to other
issues, the retaining walls around Lake Pamela have deteriorated or otherwise have
begun to fail, and
WHEREAS, the disrepair of Lake Pamela, as described herein, presents an
imminent danger to Lake Pamela itself, as well as a potential imminent danger to the
many residents and their properties which surround the Lake, and
WHEREAS, Lake Pamela comprises a portion of the Town of Henrietta’s Drainage
District and serves as a stormwater detention pond which serves not only the
immediate area within the Drainage District, but also a greater area in that Lake Pamela
also serves as a regional Stormwater management pond because it receives water from
an existing area and drains a large upstream area, and
WHEREAS, the Town’s Engineering Department as well as the Town’s consulting
Engineer, BME Associates, have advised that Lake Pamela is a critical part of the Town’s
Drainage District as well as a critical piece of regional drainage infrastructure,
particularly given Lake Pamela’s significant outlet structure and spillway, and
WHEREAS, the Town has authority to maintain and repair Lake Pamela by way of
an easement for drainage repair and maintenance on Lake Pamela, commonly known
as and referred to as “Easement #62,” which Easement #62 is more fully set forth on a
subdivision map dated September 15, 1972 entitled “Riverton Phase 1 Wildflower
Meadow,” drawn by Sear Brown and also pursuant to a Drainage Easement recorded in
the Monroe County Clerk’s Office on January 12, 1988 at Book of Deeds 7257 page 170
(the “Drainage Easement”), and
WHEREAS, the Town proposes to undertake the necessary repairs (the
“Repairs”), and
WHEREAS, the Town has applied for and has received a permit from the State
Department of Environmental Conservation (which governmental entity has jurisdiction
over the Lake), dated February 18, 2015, in which the DEC authorizes the Town to
undertake the Repairs (the “Permit”) now.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, given that Lake Pamela is a critical piece of the
Town’s Drainage District as set forth herein, the Town finds that it is in the interest of
the general public of the Town to properly maintain Lake Pamela.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that given the state of disrepair of Lake Pamela, the
imminent danger that such disrepair presents, and given its importance to the Town
generally, including to the Town’s Drainage District, and, given that the Town has the
proper basis and authority to repair Lake Pamela pursuant to Easement #62, the
Drainage Easement, and the Permit, the Town Board finds that undertaking the Repairs
is in the best interest of the Town.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Town Board hereby authorizes the Town to
undertake the Repairs to Lake Pamela in order to rectify the disrepair noted herein and,
in connection therewith, the Town Board hereby authorizes expenditure from the Town
drainage fund in an amount not to exceed sixty thousand dollars ($60,000.00).

Under discussion, Mr. Supervisor, I had two (2) points. One in the first paragraph, I
want a clarification on the zip code. It says 14467, I believe it’s 14586.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It is, it’s West Henrietta…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
It’s West Henrietta.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…that’s a clerical error.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
And furthermore the Resolution states the date of the easement as “September 15,
1972” and as you spoke it, you spoke it at September 5th, so is it the fifteenth (15th)?
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
It’s the fifteenth (15th).
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s the fifteenth (15th) as I read here, if I said the fifth (5th) I didn’t mean to.
COUNCILMAN BREESE

You have to make a correction on the Permit too with the zip code; just have DEC,
that’s also the zip code on the Permit.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Just to add to this, we’ve been talking about Lake Pamela for…
COUNCILMAN BREEZE
I was living there after I…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…twelve (12) years…

COUNCILMAN BREEZE
…got married and it’s a mess.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…at least and this is delightful.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, I’d like to be able to thank Deputy Supervisor Minotti and also our Assessor
Nathan Gabbert. Without their assistance over the last six (6) weeks and without Mr.
Young’s Law Firm, we would not have been able to obtain this and also Senator
Gallivan who promised to bail me out of jail if I went in before I got the Permit.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yes. This was big doings.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes, it’s huge. I’ve heard about Lake Pamela since, a long time ago, and the people
over there will be real happy.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Yes.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And we have to go in while the ground is frozen in order to make the repair, so…
COUNCILMAN PAGE
You picked a…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…hopefully we will start in the morning.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
You picked a good year for that.

(Laughter)
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yes, no problems.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Please call the roll.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
That concludes our business portion of the Meeting. Is there any public comment?
Mike, I don’t want you to be bashful.

(From audience, Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive, “I won’t be bashful.”)
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
You don’t have to worry about that.

(Laughter)
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive. I have a question about back in October you rezoned
some land for, at 3860 East River Road from R-15 to Industrial for Campus Crest. Well,
they came in in September, had their, put on their show then they, then in October,
prior to you approving the zoning change, I asked about their financial situation
because I read some things that they appeared to be in trouble and I asked prior, I
asked you prior Supervisor Moore, prior to the Meeting about it and then I mentioned it
during the Meeting too and it was, that was approved, the zoning changes were made.
Now I’ve read that, read in an article published today that the CEO was replaced
because of dismal results back in November and then, in the article today it also says
that Campus Crest is being, it looks like it’s being taken over by a rival company, it
looks like. I just wondered is Campus Crest done with that piece of property?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
At this point they have, any options they had on the property have expired…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…but a zoning change stays with the property so it is Industrial. There is another entity
that seems to have some interest in it and has contacted the Deputy Supervisor about
moving forward. Whether that happens or not, I don’t know because there’s also
19

TB February 18, 2015
another student housing company a little bit south of there that’s looking at a proposal
and I don’t believe RIT could probably withstand both developments, so probably one
of them will be done and the other one won’t.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay. That was my question, if the rezoning still changes, even though the project that
it was approved for doesn’t.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes, well a zoning change stays with the property…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right, so…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…and I mean it just happens student housing is permissible under our Industrial Zone
with a Special Permit from the Town Board.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay, so basically anything can move in that, now that it’s rezoned Industrial, basically
anything can move in there…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You’re correct…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
…even though…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…your friends Hammer…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
(Inaudible) get a Special Permit though.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
What’s that?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Your friends at Hammer could expand.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay, well, but even though they, so even though they…

TB February 18, 2015
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
They’d have to come in and get a Special Permit.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Permit, but do…?
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
The new people.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right, but now that it’s been rezoned, so, okay.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
(Inaudible.)
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But all the land contingent to that is already Industrial, so it’s a very natural thing to
have rezoned that Industrial.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Yes. Okiedoke, thanks.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. Is there anybody else that would like to come before the Board? (Pause,
no response.) May I have a motion to adjourn please.
The Regular Meeting of the Henrietta Town Board was moved for adjournment by
Councilwoman Zinck, seconded by Councilman Mulligan at 7:27 P.M. and was adjourned
without objection.
Respectfully submitted,

Jennifer L. Miranda
Deputy Town Clerk
