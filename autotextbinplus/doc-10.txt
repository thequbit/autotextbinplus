SUPERVISOR MOORE
This concludes our business portion of the Meeting. Is there anybody in the audience
that would like to have some public comment? Mr. Stafford. Understand the roads are
bad and the staff would like to leave early.

(Laughter)
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Mike Stafford, 32 Essex. I just wanted to, I think it should be noted that I attended the
Winter Fest last Saturday with my son and I think that all the employees who worked
on that, you know on a Saturday and setting up for it should be noted for doing a great
job. It was very enjoyable and I told my kid we could attend next year, my son and I, I
just wanted to note that.

COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Thank you.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
I would like to know one other thing that came out of the twenty-first (21st) I think of
January when the Town got the letter from Ridgeland Residential asking for postponing
of the questions that they said they would have answered in a week from the prior
Meeting. Has the Town Received any of those?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
No, at this point they actually asked to have that removed and the attorney that was
here representing the other folks was the same attorney and they will be back; they are
actually addressing the residents’ concerns over there and they have, I think
established then they’ll have a new resident Meeting to try to explain what they can do
to offset some of the problems with traffic and noise and some of the other issues.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
But you haven’t gotten issued a letter addressing these issues.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Before they’ll come back and it will be entertained here at the Town Board, they will
answer those questions and we will put them on the, on our website.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay. Thanks a lot.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You’re welcome.

it the day before when it was windy and...”)
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK

the tent…”)
