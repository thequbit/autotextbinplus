OPEN FORUM:
Residents along Glen Road addressed the committee about proposed parking changes and

OLD BUSINESS:
MATTER RE: Proposed No Parking - Chelmsford Road Triangle – Follow Up – Keef
Chelmsford Road/12 Corners Plaza - have continued dialogue with Mike Tuohey. Will be modifying
the location of a couple of the signs already in place along Chelmsford Road
MATTER RE: Corbett's Glen parking on Glen Road – Keef
The public hearing remains open and will resume at this week's TB meeting. Not all of the neighbors
are in agreement as to what needs to be done. Tim Keef has spoken with a few of them and they are
trying to arrive at some consensus themselves, but that hasn't happened yet.
MATTER RE: CSX Railroad Safety & Access – Clover Street – Cline
Contact has been established with CSX and a contact will try to be at the next meeting to discuss
gate options, it appears that a portion of the access is within the Town of Brighton property and some
private property.
MATTER RE: School Bus Complaint @ 2500 Elmwood Avenue – DiPonzio
County of Monroe has installed a “school bus stop ahead” sign in the westbound lane of Elmwood
Avenue. Homeowner was at the meeting expressed here appreciation to the committee for the new
signage.

MATTER RE: Roselawn Neighborhood Stop Sign Request - Rebecca Weber
Matter will be on Oct 24th TB meeting to set public hearing for installation of signs on intersecting
side streets. See attached letter to Town Board for signage locations.
MATTER RE: Blossom Road @ Landing Road – Intersection Safety – Keef
Blossom and North Landing Road - we are looking at what additional signage we may be able to
install along North Landing approaches to the intersection. We have sent a communication to
NYSDOT to evaluate Blossom Road in the same manner, including considering installation of a traffic
signal. No response at this time.
NEW BUSINESS:
MATTER RE: Children at Play Signage – Kimbark Road - Heather Verbree.
