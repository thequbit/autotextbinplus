MATTER RE: Children at Play Signage Request – Keef
Tim addressed the committee and presented that these signs are not federal recognized signage and wanted
permission to address these requests administrative without having to bring to this committee each time. Committee
agreed that this could now be handled administrative by staff.

MATTER RE: Reserve Fire Department Access – Roth
Quint 300 does not maneuver cleanly and ask that a tree be removed and installation of end of pavement markers
to ensure the safe operation of the largest piece of Brighton Fire District apparatus.
An overall height of the bridge sign shall be posted to provide height information to any apparatus driver of the
height limitations due to the South Clinton Avenue Bridge.
The overall construction and use of the alternate emergency access route completed better than previous
expectations, the incline entering from the canal path is very minimal and lighting and access appears to be very
user friendly.
MATTER RE: Food Truck – Fire Safety – Roth
Discussion about food truck placement at the Farmers Market as well as fire safety procedures food truck must
complete through the City of Rochester Fire Department. These fire safety measures will assist with our concerns as
most food trucks already participate somewhere within the City of Rochester.
