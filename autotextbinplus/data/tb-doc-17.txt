Re:

Transportation Alternative Program, (TAP)
Farash Property Shared Use Trail

Dear Councilperson Werner and Committee Members:
We are requesting that the FASC recommend that the Town Board authorize the preparation
of a Transportation Alternative Program, TAP, grant application to fund the design,
construction observation and construction of the Farash Property Shar,ed Use Trail project.
The Transportation Alternatives Program provides funding for programs and projects defined
as transportation alternatives, including on- and off-road pedestrian and bicycle facilities,
infrastructure projects for improving non-driver access to public transportation and enhanced
mobility, community improvement activities, and environmental mitigation; safe routes to
school projects; and projects for planning, designing, or constructing boulevards and other
roadways largely in the right-of-way of former Interstate System routes or other divided
highways. The TAP is a reimbursement program. The Town would be required to pay project
expenses first and then apply to the NYSDOT for reimbursement. The NYSDOT would then
apply to the Federal Highway Administration for reimbursement of up to 80% of the project
costs. The remaining 20% or local share would be paid by the Town of Brighton. The
design, construction observation and construction costs are estimated to be $656,070.00 of
which 80% or $ $524,856.00 will be reimbursed by the TAP. The remaining 20%,
$131,214.00 or locaL share will be reimbursed by the Town of Brighton.
As always, thank you for your consideration. I will be in attendance at your regularly
scheduled April 15, 2014 meeting in the event that you have any questions regarding this
matter.
