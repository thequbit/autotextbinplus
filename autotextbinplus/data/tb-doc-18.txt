Re:

Request for Proposals, (RFP)
Farash Property Shared Use Trail
Professional Services

Dear Councilperson Werner and Committee Members:
The Town Board authorized the preparation and solicitation of a request for proposal for
professional consulting services on January 8, 2014 for the Farash Property Shared Use
Trail Project. The project includes the construction of a shared use trail on the parcel
known as the Farash property. The proposed trail will extend from Westfall Road to
Elmwood Avenue in a north to south direction and provide a critical link between the
Town of Brighton Town Hall and Buckland Park. The Town of Brighton solicited a
Request Proposals for professional services for this project in February 2014. The
Request for Proposal was advertised in the NYS Contract Reporter on February 4, 2014
and responses were requested and received on February 27, 2014. Approximately forty
(40) firms obtained copies of the RFQ and fourteen firms submitted a response to the
Request for Proposal.
Town staff evaluated the proposals and after nuich deliberation the consultant Bayer
Landscape Architecture, PLLC was selected. While not the lowest fee, Bayer Landscape
Architecture, PLLC provided a very competitive price and their proposal demonstrated a
clear understanding of the project scope, exceptional local knowledge of the project site,
and notable experience with similar projects. The bidders along with their proposed notto-exceed fee are listed in Appendix A.
The Bayer Landscape Architecture, PLLC price proposal indicates that a maximum notto-exceed price to provide those services outlined in the RFP including Construction
Administration and Inspection is $117,550.00. We are proposing to award the entire
contract for a fee not to exceed $117,550.00.

Set-Up Capital Project and Appropriate Trust Funds
For Trail through former Farash Property

I am recommending that your Honorable Body authorize the creation of a capital
project for the design and construction of a shared use trail through the former
Farash property that will extend from Westfall Road to Elmwood Avenue
connecting Town Hall with Buckland Park. The majority of the funding for this
trail will be provided through existing funds in the Town’s Parkiand Trust and
Parks Reserve accounts.
The initial contract for professional consulting services in the design of the park
trail is expected to be for a cost not-to-exceed $117,550. I am requesting
authorization to appropriate the $117,550 for engineering services in the newly
created capital project with offsetting revenue of a transfer in from the Parkland
Trust Fund.
To summarize, my formal requests to the Town Board are:
• To authorize the creation of a capital project for the design and
construction of a trail through the former Farash property
• To authorize the appropriation of $117,550 from the Parkiand Trust Fund
to the engineering services line of the capital budget for the trail
• To authorize the Director of Finance to make all necessary accounting
entries relating to this appropriation.
I will be happy to respond to any questions that members of the Committee or
other members of the Town Board may have regarding this matter.

Dear Chairperson Werner and Committee Members:
As we have done so in past years, it is recommended that the ten hour day be considered again
for the upcoming 2014 seasonal summer period. Last year’s ten hour day efforts assisted greatly with
both the Highway and Sewer Department’s programs and projects. Therefore, I request your
endorsement for the upcoming year and, if you look upon this favorably, to recommend that the MOA
between the Town, CSEA and/or the Teamsters be executed by the Supervisor.
As always, thank you for your consideration. I will be in attendance at your regularly scheduled
April 1, 2014 meeting in the event that you have any questions regarding this matter.

It is hereby agreed between the parties hereto to adopt and institute the
following provisions relative to the accounting of time during a trial of a 10
hour work day during the period 5/19/14 to 8/29/14 (the “Trial Period”).
The start and end time for work each day during the stated trial period shall
be 6:30 AM and 4:30 PM, respectively. The holiday weeks of 5/26/14 to
5/30/14 and 6/30/14 to 7/4/14 will be worked as noted further herein.
Article VIII, section 1 of the collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) shall
remain in full force and effect. This M.O.A. is intended to supplement the
collective bargaining agreement and to clarify the treatment of certain paid
leave during the Trial Period and during that trial period only.
Article VIII, section 5 of the CBA is modified to describe the “weekends”,
for which sewer department standby is to be paid, to include the following
Fridays within the above referenced period of 2014: May 23, 30; June 6, 13,
20, 27; July 4, 11, 18, 25; August 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Employees assigned to
standby on those weekends will: receive two hours pay at time and one-half
for those Fridays, rather than the one and one half hours pay at time and one
half provided by contract; and, one and one half hours pay at time and one
half for the standby on those Thursdays immediately preceding those
Fridays.
The holidays and associated respective holiday weeks that fall within the
trial period (i.e. Memorial Day and Independence Day) shall be worked and
paid as follows:
Five eight hour days totaling forty hours for the week, with the
designated holiday being observed as denoted on the Town’s holiday
schedule for 2014. During these weeks, the terms and conditions of
the CBA shall be in effect. The start and end time for work each day

respectively.
Article IX, section 4 of the CBA is modified to clarify that the floating
holidays shall total forty (40) hours. Article IX, section 5 of the CBA is
modified to describe pay, for floating holidays taken in the Trial Period, as

any fractional floating holidays remaining (i.e., less than 4 hours), this
fraction shall be taken in one incident, at the beginning or end of the work
day, on or before 11/30/14, and at a time of mutual convenience. The Town
shall post, during the week of 9/15/14, a listing of employees with any
fractional holidays remaining.
Article X of the CBA is modified to restate the sick leave entitlements as the
product of the number of days described times eight hours. Article X,
section 5 of the CBA is modified to describe pay, for each day of sick leave
taken in the Trial Period, as being ten (10) hours. Days, for the purposes of
section 6 of Article X of the CBA, shall be counted as 10 hours during the
Trial period.
Article XIV, section 1 of the CBA is modified to clarify that the personal
days shall total sixteen (16) hours. Pay, for each day of personal leave taken
in the Trial Period, shall be ten (10) hours. Pay, for each half-day of personal
leave taken in the Trial Period, shall be five (5) hours. If, at the end of the
Trial Period, an employee has any fractional personal leave remaining (i.e.,
less than 4 hours), this fraction shall be taken in one incident, at the
beginning or end of the work day, on or before 11/30/14, and at a time of
mutual convenience. The Town shall post, during the week of 9/15/14, a
listing of employees with any fractional personal leave remaining.

eligibility as the product of the number of days described times eight hours.
Pay, for each day of vacation taken in the Trial Period, shall be ten (10)
hours. Pay, for each half-day of vacation taken in the Trial Period, shall be
five (5) hours. If, at the end of the Trial Period, an employee has any
fractional vacation time remaining (i.e., less than 4 hours), this fraction shall
be taken in one incident, at the beginning or end of the work day, on or
before 11/30/14, and at a time of mutual convenience. The Town shall post,
during the week of 9/15/14, a listing of employees with any fractional
vacation remaining.
Furthermore, in order to efficiently execute the scope and services provided
by the Operations Center, fractional time shall not be utilized in conjunction

Purpose
The purpose of this Investment Policy Statement (IPS) is to assist the Board of Trustees (Board)
in effectively supervising, monitoring and evaluating the investment of the Town’s Length of
Service Award Plan (Plan) assets. The Plan’s investment program is defined in the various
sections of this IPS by:
1. Stating in a written document the Board’s attitudes, expectations. objectives and
guidelines for the investment of all of the Plan’s assets.
2. Encouraging effective communications between the Board and all parties involved with the
investment management decisions.
3. Establishing formal criteria to select, monitor, evaluate and compare the performance results
achieved by each investment option on a regular basis.
4. Setting forth an investment structure for managing the Plan’s assets. This structure includes
various asset classes, investment management styles, asset allocation and acceptable ranges
that, in total, are expected to produce an appropriate level of overall diversification and total
investment return over the investment time horizon.
5. Providing guidelines for each investment portfolio that control the level of overall risk and
liquidity assumed in that portfolio, so all Plan assets are managed in accordance with stated
objectives.

Statement of Objectives
Background
The Plan is a defined benefit plan and currently covers 52 participants. Plan size is currently
$925,000 and annual contributions should total $0. The purpose of the plan is to retain and
recruit active volunteer firefighters and/or EMT’s.
This IPS has been arrived at upon consideration by the Board by a wide range of policies, and
describes the prudent investment process the Board deems appropriate. This process
includes offering various asset classes and investment management styles that, in total, are
expected to offer the opportunity to diversify the portfolio in a manner consistent with the specified
risk and return requirements of the portfolio.
The objectives of the Plan are:
1. Have the ability to pay all benefit and expense obligations when due.
2. Control costs of administering the plan and managing the investments.
3. Maximize return within reasonable and prudent levels of risk in order to minimize contributions.
Time Horizon
The investment guidelines are based upon an investment horizon of greater than five years. The
Plan’s strategic asset allocation is also based on this long-term perspective. Short-term liquidity
requirements are anticipated to be covered by the plans assets.
Risk Tolerances
The Board recognizes that some risk must be assumed in order to achieve the investment
objectives of the plan. In establishing the risk tolerances of the IPS, the ability to withstand short
and intermediate term variability were considered.
A 1-yr loss limit of -9.5% has been calculated for the portfolio. Statistically speaking, there is a
5% chance (once in every twenty years) that the 1-year return will actually be lower than -9.5%.
In summary, The Plan’s long time horizon, current financial condition and several other factors
suggest collectively some interim fluctuations in market value and rates of return may be tolerated
in order to achieve the longer-term objectives.
Performance Expectations
The desired investment objective is a long-term rate of return on assets that is at least 6.00%.
The target rate of return for the Plan has been based upon the assumption that future real returns
will approximate the long-term rates of return experienced for each asset class in the IPS.
The Board realizes market performance varies and a 6.00% rate of return may not be
meaningful during some periods. Accordingly, relative performance benchmarks for the
investment options are set forth in the “Monitoring” section.

Duties and Responsibilities
Board of Trustees
As fiduciaries under the Plan, the primary responsibilities of the Board are:
Prepare and maintain this investment policy statement.
Prudently diversify the Plan’s assets to meet an agreed upon risk/return profile.
Prudently select investment options.
Control and account for all investment, record keeping and administrative expenses associated

Investment Advisor
The Investment Advisor serves as an objective, third-party professional retained to assist the
Board in managing the overall investment process. The Advisor is responsible for managing the
assets and guiding the Board through a disciplined and rigorous investment process to enable the
Board to meet the fiduciary responsibilities outlined above.

Asset Class Guidelines
The Board believes long-term investment performance, in large part, is primarily a function of
asset class mix. The Board has reviewed the long-term performance characteristics of the
broad asset classes, focusing on balancing the risks and rewards.
Historically while interest-generating investments, such as bonds, have the advantage of relative
stability of principal value, they provide little opportunity for real long-term capital growth due to
their susceptibility to inflation. On the other hand, equity investments, such as common stocks,
clearly have a significantly higher expected return but have the disadvantage of much greater
year-by-year variability of return. From an investment decision-making point of view, this
year-by-year variability may be worth accepting given the Plan’s long time horizon.
The following asset classes were selected and ranked in ascending order of “risk” (least to most)
according to the most recent quarter’s median 3-year Standard Deviation values.
Money Market Taxable
Short-Term Bond
Intermediate-Term Bond
Conservative Allocation
Multi-sector Bond
Inflation-Protected Bond

Moderate Allocation
World Bond
World Allocation
Large Blend
Foreign Large Blend
Mid-Cap Blend
Small Blend
Specialty-Real Estate
Specialty-Natural Res
Other
The performance expectations (both risk and return) of each broad asset class are contained in
Appendix A.
Rebalancing of Strategic Allocation
The percentage allocation to each asset class may vary depending upon market conditions.
Please reference the allocation table in the Executive Summary for the lower and upper limits for
each asset class. When necessary and/or available, cash inflows/outflows will be deployed in a
manner consistent with the strategic asset allocation and allocation ranges of the Plan. If there
are no cash flows, the allocation of the Plan will be reviewed quarterly.
If the Board judges cash flows to be insufficient to bring the Plan within the target allocation
ranges, the Board shall decide whether to effect transactions to bring the allocation of Plan
assets within the threshold ranges.

Implementation
The Board will apply the following due diligence criteria in selecting each money manager or
mutual fund.
1. Regulatory oversight: Each investment option should be managed by: (i) a bank; (ii) an
insurance company; (iii) a registered investment company (mutual fund); or, (iiii) a
registered investment adviser.
2. Correlation to style or peer group: The investment option should be highly correlated to the
asset class being implemented. This is one of the most critical parts of the analysis since most
of the remaining due diligence involves comparisons of the investment option to the
appropriate peer group.
3. Performance relative to a peer group: The investment option’s performance should be
evaluated against the peer group’s median manager return, for 1-, 3- and 5-year cumulative
periods.
4. Performance relative to assumed risk: The investment option’s risk-adjusted performance
(Alpha and/or Sharpe Ratio) should be evaluated against the peer group’s median manager’s
risk-adjusted performance.
5. Minimum track record: The investment option should have sufficient history so that
performance statistics can be properly calculated.
6. Assets in the product: The investment option should have sufficient assets so that the portfolio
manager can properly trade the account.

7. Holdings consistent with style: The underlying securities of the investment option should be
consistent with the associated broad asset class.
8. Expense ratios/fees: The investment options fees should be fair and reasonable. Core/Satellite
approach can be implemented to control expenses. This is the recognition that passive
management and index funds should be used for the more efficient asset classes combined
with active management for less efficient asset classes.
9. Stability of the organization: There should be no perceived organizational problems.

Monitoring
Performance Objectives
The Board acknowledges fluctuating rates of return characterize the securities markets,
particularly during short-term time periods. Recognizing that short-term fluctuations may cause
variations in performance, the Board intends to evaluate investment performance from a
long-term perspective.
The Board is aware the ongoing review and analysis of the investment options is just as
important as the due diligence process. The performance of the investment options will be
monitored on an ongoing basis and it is at the Board’s discretion to take corrective action by
replacing a manager if they deem it appropriate at any time.
On a timely basis, but not less than annually, the Board will meet to review whether each
investment option continues to conform to the search criteria outlined in the implementation
section; specifically:
1. The investment option’s adherence to the watch list criteria;
2. Material changes in the investment option’s organization, investment philosophy and/or
personnel; and,
3. Any legal, SEC and/or other regulatory agency proceedings affecting the investment options
organization.
Benchmarks
The Board has determined it is in the best interest of the Plan’s participants that performance
objectives be established for each investment option. Manager performance will be evaluated in
terms of an appropriate market index (e.g. the S&P 500 stock index for large-cap domestic equity
manager) and the relevant peer group (e.g. the large-cap growth mutual fund universe for a
large-cap growth mutual fund).

Watch List Criteria
An investment option may be placed on a Watch List and a thorough review and analysis of the
investment option may be conducted, when:
1. An investment option performs below median for their peer group over a 1-, 3- and/or 5-year
cumulative period.
2. An investment options 3-year risk adjusted return (Alpha and/or Sharpe) falls below the peer
group’s median risk adjusted return.
3. There is a change in the professionals managing the investment option.
4. There is a significant decrease or increase in the investment option’s assets.
5. There is an indication the investment option is deviating from the stated style and/or strategy.
6. There is an increase in the investment option’s fees and expenses.
7. Any extraordinary event occurs that may interfere with the investment option’s abihty to

prudently manage investment assets.
The decision to retain or terminate an investment option cannot be made by a formula. It is the
Boards confidence in the investment option’s ability to perform in the future that ultimately
determines the retention of an investment option.

Measuring Costs
The Board will review at least annually all costs associated with the management of the Plan,
including:
1. Expense ratios of each mutual fund against the appropriate peer group.
2. Administrative Fees; costs to administer the Plan, including record keeping, custody and trust
services.
3. The proper identification and accounting of all parties receiving soft dollars and/or 12b-1 fees
generated by the Portfolio.

Investment Policy Review
The Board will review this IPS at least annually to determine whether stated investment
objectives are still relevant and the continued feasibility of achieving the same. It is not expected
that the IPS will change frequently. In particular, short-term changes in the financial markets
should not require adjustments to the IPS.

Re:

Birchcrest Tree and Landscape
Additional Services
Supply and Install Bench

Dear Councilperson Werner and Committee Members:
At the August 8, 2012 meeting the Town of Brighton Town Board awarded the contract for the
Veterans Memorial Site Improvements to Birchcrest Tree and Landscape, Inc. for a total cost not
to exceed $64,968.52. The Town Board has since authorized three change orders totaling
$52,360.95. The total project cost including the change orders is $117,329.47. A copy of the
previous change orders are attached for the Committee’s reference. The project has been
completely funded by donations and grant moneys.
The memorial currently includes a single bench which provides minimal seating capacity. A
second bench would improve the seating capacity at the memorial. Therefore, I am requesting
that FASC authorize the Town Board to increase the Birchcrest Tree and Landscape, Inc. contract
and authorize the Supervisor to execute Change Order Number 4 to purchase and install an new
bench in the amount of $2,700.00. Purchasing the bench using the existing Birchcrest contract
ensures that the new bench will be similar to the existing bench. A copy of the change order is
attached for your reference.
I will be in attendance at your regularly scheduled April 1, 2014 meeting in the event that you
have any questions regarding this correspondence. As always, your consideration of matters such
as this is greatly appreciated.
Sincerely

/
