Local Law #3 of 2014
Best Value Pricing Local Law
Section 1.

Title

This Local Law shall be known as the Best Value Pricing Local Law of the Town
of Brighton.
Section 2.

Purpose.

It is the purpose and intent of this Local Law to authorize the award of contracts
on the basis of Best Value for the purchase of goods or services in accordance
with Section 103(1) of the New York State General Municipal Law. Such Best
Value awards will not apply to contracts for public works projects.
Section 3.

Text of Local Law

Pursuant to the provisions of New York State General Municipal Law Section
103(1), the Town of Brighton, New York, located in the County of Monroe,
hereby authorizes the use of “best value”, as that term is defined in Section 163
of the State Finance Law, for awarding purchase contracts other than purchase
contracts for the completion of a public works contract pursuant to Article 8 of the
Labor Law.
Section 4.

Effective Date

This Local Law shall take effect immediately upon filing with the Secretary of
State.

STATE FINANCE LAW SECTION 163

•

i. “Best value” means the basis for awarding contracts for services to the offerer which
optimizes quality, cost and efficiency, among responsive and responsible offerers. Such
basis shall reflect, wherever possible, objective and quantifiable analysis. Such basis
may also identify a quantitative factor for offerers that are small businesses or certified
minority- or women-owned business enterprises as defined in subdivisions one, seven,
fifteen and twenty of section three hundred ten of the executive law to be used in
evaluation of offers for awarding of contracts for services.

§ 103.. Advertising for bids and offers; letting of contracts; criminal
1. [Until June 1, 2018] Except as otherwise expressly provided by an act of the legislature or by
a local law adopted prior to Septenter first, nineteen hundred fifty-three, all contracts for public
work involving an expenditure of more than thirty-five thousand dollars and all purchase contracts
involving an expenditure of more than twenty thousand dollars, shall be awarded by the
appropriate officer, board or agency of a political subdivision or of any district therein including
but not limited to a soil conservation district [fig 1] to the lowest responsible bidder furnishing the
required security after advertisement for sealed bids in the manner provided by this section [fig
2], provided, however, that purchase contracts (including contracts for service work, but
excluding any purchase contracts necessary for the completion of a public works contract
pursuant to article eight of the labor law) [fig 3]may be awarded on the basis of best value, as
defined in section one hundred sixty-three of the state finance law, to a responsive and
responsible bidder or offerer in the manner provided by this section except that in a political
subdivision other than a city with a population of one million inhabitants or more or any district,
board or agency with jurisdiction exclusively therein the use of best value for awarding a
purchase contract or purchase contracts must be authorized by local law or, in the case of a
district corporation, school district or board of cooperative educational services, by rule,
regulation or resolution adopted at a public meeting. In any case where a responsible bidder’s or
responsible offerer’s gross price is reducible by an allowance for the value of used machinery,
equipment, apparatus or tools to be traded in by a political subdivision, the gross price shall be
reduced by the amount of such allowance, for the purpose of determining the best value. In cases
where two or more responsible bidders furnishing the required security submit identical bids as to
price, such officer, board or agency may award the contract to any of such bidders. Such officer,
board or agency may, in his or her or its discretion, reject all bids or offers and readvertise for
new bids or offers in the manner provided by this section. In determining whether a purchase is an
expenditure within the discretionary threshold amounts established by this subdivision, the officer,
board or agency of a political subdivision or of any district therein shall consider the reasonably
expected aggregate amount of all purchases of the same commodities, services or technology to
be made within the twelve-month period cormiencing on the date of purchase. Purchases of
commodities, services or technology shall not be artificially divided for the purpose of satisfying
the discretionary buying thresholds established by this subdivision. A change to or a renewal of a
discretionary purchase shall not be permitted if the change or renewal would bring the reasonably
expected aggregate amount of all purchases of the same commodities, services or technology
from the same provider within the twelve-month period commencing on the date of the first
purchase to an amount greater than the discretionary buying threshold amount. For purposes of
this section, “seated bids” and “sealed offers”, as that term applies to purchase contracts,
(including contracts for service work, but excluding any purchase contracts necessary for the
completion of a public works contract pursuant to article eight of the labor law) shall include bids
and offers submitted in an electronic format including submission of the statement of non-collusion
required by section one hundred three-d of this article, provided that the governing board of the
political subdivision or district, by resolution, has authorized the receipt of bids and offers in such
format. Submission in electronic format may, for technology contracts only, be required as the
sole method for the submission of bids and offers. Bids and offers submitted in an electronic
format shall be transmitted by bidders and offerers to the receiving device designated by the
political subdivision or district. Any method used to receive electronic bids and offers shall comply
with article three of the state technology law, and any rules and regulations promulgated and
guidelines developed thereunder and, at a minimum, must (a) document the time and date of
receipt of each bid and offer received electronically; (b) authenticate the identity of the sender;
(c) ensure the security of the information transmitted; and Cd) ensure the confidentiality of the
bid or offer until the time and date established for the opening of bids or offers. The timely
submission of an electronic bid or offer in compliance with instructions provided for such
submission in the advertisement for bids or offers and/or the specifications shall be the
responsibility solely of each bidder or offerer or prospective bidder or offerer. No political
subdivision or district therein shall incur any liability from delays of or Interruptions in the receiving
device designated for the submission and receipt of electronic bids and offers.

EXCERPT FROM “SEEKING COMPETITION iN PROCUREMENT”
(footnote omitted)
the statutory
Local governments and school districts may elect to award purchase contracts which exceed
value”
threshold (i.e., $20,000) to a resptinsive and responsible offeror on the basis of “best
(“competitive offering”), instead of to the lowest responsible bidder.io For this purpose, the term
“purchase contract” includes contracts for service work, but excludes contracts necessary for the
completion of a public works contract covered by the prevailing wage provisions of article 8 of the
Labor Law, such as for building construction.ti Towns, villages, cities (except New York City) and
of local law.
counties must first authorize the use of best value for awarding purchase contracts by the adoption a
District corporations (e.g., fire districts), school districts, or boards of cooperative educational services
public
(BOCES) must first authorize the use of best value by rule, regulation or resolution adopted at a
meeting.

“Best value” is defined for this purpose as a basis for awarding contracts “tO the offerer which optimizes
best
quality, cost and efficiency, among responsive and responsible offerers.”iz Therefore, in assessing
factors can
value, non-price factors can be considered when awarding the purchase contract. Non-price
include, but are not limited to, reliability of a product, efficiency of operation, difficuky/ease of
maintenance, useful lifespan, ability to meet needs regarding timeliness of performance, and experience
of a service provider with similar contracts. The basis for a best value award, however, must reflect,
whenever possible, objective and quantifiable analysis.13
For purposes of best value, a responsive offeror is an offeror meeting the minimum specificationsi4 As
discussed above, in assessing whether an offeror is responsible, a local government or school district
should consider an offeror’s capacity and financial ability to complete the contract, accountability, past
perforthance, reliability and rntegrlty.is
Accordingly, should the local government or school district elect to award a purchase contract on the
basis of best value, the local government or school district must be prepared to show that (1) the offeror
is responsive and responsible; and (2) iocai officials applied objective and quantifiable standards,
whenever possible, to determine that the offer optimizes quality, cost and efficiency. The local
government or school district should have a written justification if it bases a best value award on criteria
that are not objective and quantifiable.
The best value specification should describe the general manner in which the evaluation and award of
offers ‘will be conducted and, as appropriate, identify the relative importance or weighting of price and
non-price factors.is As noted, the decision to award a contract on the basis of best value must be based
on objective and quantifiable analysis, such as a cost-benefit analysis, whenever possible. In evaluating
and determining to accept a higher priced offer, the local government or school district generally should
use a cost-benefit analysis to show quantifiable value or savings from non-price factors that offset the
price differential of the lower price offers. The local government or school district’s procurement
policies and procedures should require documentation of this analysis.ii
Whether a local government or school district elects to award a purchase contract based on lowest
responsible bidder or best value, they are required to comply with public advertising and bid/offer
opening requirements that apply to purchase contracts above existing statutory thresholds.is

Cost-Benefit Analysis

A local government solicits competitive offers to purchase a new pickup truck. Vendof A offers the
lowest priced truck at $40,000. Vendor B offers a more fuel-efficient truck at a price of $45,000. Both

vendors are responsive and responsible offerors. The local government reasonably estimates its
average annual fuel costs to be $4,000 for Vendor A’s truck and $3,000 for Vendor B’s truck. The
local government also concludes, based on reliable independent studies and assuming current usage of
the vehicle, the more fuel efficient truck (Vendor B) will likely have $250 less in maintenance costs
annually than Vendor A (assuming maintenance costs of $1,000 annually for Vendor A’s truck). The
local government determines the expected useful life of a new truck to be 10 years and intends to
retain the truck for the full useful life. In order to quantify these other critical aspects relating to the
new pick up truck purchase, the local government prepares the following cost-benefit analysis:

Vendor A

Vendor B

Price (Truck)

$40,000

45,0O0

Fuel Costs over Useful
Life (10 Years)

$40,000

$30,000

Maintenance Costs
over Useful Life (10
Years)

$10,000

$7,500

Total Cost

$90,000

$82,500

Based on this analysis, it may be possible for the local government to support a determination that the
truck from Vendor B provides the “best value” to the local government.
