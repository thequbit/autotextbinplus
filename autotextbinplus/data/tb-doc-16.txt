Re: Appropriation of Funds

Honorable Supervisor and Members of the Board:

I recommend that the Town Board amend the 2014 Budget by increasing and appropriating $610.00
from other revenue in the town-wide street lighting account (A.DPW.5182 1289), and by increasing
appropriations in the contract services line (A.DPW.5 182 4.49) by the like amount.
The revenue was not anticipated, and came as a reimbursement for relocating two (2) Town owned
streetlights on Monroe Ave. (BRL184 and BRL199). The two street lights on existing RG&E poles had
to be adjusted in order to accommodate new overhead cables.

Timothy J. Anderson

Re:

The Reserve Subdivision
Construction Observation Services Phase 2

Dear Councilperson Werner and Committee Members:
The Town of Brighton prepared requests for proposal for construction observation services to oversee the
construction of Phase I of the Reserve Subdivision in July 2012. Chatfield Engineers, P.C., the low bidder,
was awarded the construction observation contract at the August 22, 2012 Town Board meeting. Phase I of
The Reserve Subdivision project is nearing completion and we anticipate that the construction of the
infrastructure and roadway serving Phase 2 will begin this summer. Phase 2 includes the construction of
approximately 227 residential units, public and private roadways and public watermain, sanitary sewers and
storm sewers.
lam requesting authorization to amend the agreement between the Town of Brighton and Chatfield
Engineers, P.C. to include the construction observation services for Phase 2 of the Reserve Subdivision.
The Consultant has agreed that said services shall be rendered as outlined in a Proposal titled, “Request for
Proposal Provide Construction Observation Services for The Reserve Subdivision Town of Brighton,
Monroe County New York dated, July 25, 2012”, attached. These services shall be rendered at the 2013
hourly rates specified in the July 25, 2012 proposal. The owner estimates that the Phase 2 construction will
require approximately 390 hours of full time inspection. Of the 390 hours 78 hours are anticipated as
overtime and will be paid at an hourly rate that is 1.5 times the base rate. We estimate that the cost to
provide full time inspection for Phase 2 of the Reserve Subdivision will be $28,080.00.
Monies were not specifically earmarked for this particular project however; the cost of these construction
observation services will be reimbursed by the developer and obtained prior to the start of Phase 2
construction.
As always, thank you for your consideration. I will be in attendance at your regularly scheduled May 6,
2014 meeting in the eient that you have any questions regarding this matter.
Respectlly

Re:

Proposed Parking Restrictions
Buckland Park Entrance Road

Dear Supervisor Moehie and Town Council Members:
As you may be aware the entrance road to Buckland Park is used by Park visitors for the parking
of their vehicles during certain events. This has been problematic at times due to the narrowing of the
pavement, causing concern for accessibility to the area by emergency vehicles, as well as inherent safety
concerns due to pedestrian traffic along the road and between sports fields. The Parks, Recreation and
Community Services Committee is in favor of this proposal, having recommended this action at their
April 2014 meeting. Therefore, it is proposed to restrict parking in accordance with Town and Highway
Law as outlined below to make the area safer and more manageable:
1)

along both the east and west sides of the entrance road to Buckland Park, authorize no parking
at all times from the intersection of Westfall Road and 650 feet to the south, which is the
beginning of the formal parking lot;
For your reference an aerial photo depicting the above stated information is attached.

I would therefore ask that the Town Board receive and file this communication, that a public
hearing be set for this matter and that any requisite notification be sent out. As always, your
consideration of matters such as this is greatly appreciated.
