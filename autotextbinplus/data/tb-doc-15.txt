Re: Mechanical street sweeper bid
Tim,
I recommend that we accept the bid from Joe Johnson Equipment for a 2014 Elgin
Pelican street sweeper for a delivered price of $190,900. Joe Johnson Equipment is the
only bid out of the three bids submitted that meets the bidder qualifications and did not
take any exceptions to the specifications. The other two bids submitted do not meet
bidder qualifications and have exceptions to the minimum technical specifications.
Cyncon Equipment took numerous exceptions to the specifications. Vantage
Equipment, LLC submitted a bid for a cab and chassis mounted sweeper design. The
bid specifications are for a three wheel street sweeper front hopper dump configuration.
The above recommended street sweeper best fits the Highway Department needs and
will be replacing a similar model.
Cyncon Equipment took thirty one exceptions to the minimum requirements. Some of
the major exceptions included front steer three wheel configuration instead of rear steer,
engine is a Tier 3 instead of a Tier 4i, which is cleaner burning, forward reverse is shifter
control instead of foot pedal operated, and brakes require electrical and engine power to
dis-engage. Cyncon Equipment submitted a bid for a Global M-3 street sweeper with a
delivered price of $172,760.
Vantage Equipment, LLC submitted a bid for a cab and chassis mounted Street sweeper
which is a completely different design than the street sweeper specified and therefore
does not match up with the Town’s specifications. They also did not fully meet bidder
qualifications. Vantage Equipment, LLC submitted a bid for a Stewart Amos street
sweeper with a delivered price of $190,792.
The street sweeper is a budgeted item in the D. HWY. 5130 2.23 machinery account.

Contractor Recommendation for
2015 Refuse Districts Services

Re:

Dear Councilperson Werner and Committee Members:
The Department of Public Works put together Contract Documents for the annual Refuse Districts
Services within the Town of Brighton for the 2015 year with four one year renewals. The contract
documents were publicly advertised and due on May 7, 2014. Town staff also notified eight contractors
regarding this project. Attached is a copy of the public notice along with the Bid Result. Below is Table-i
which lists the bids that were received from contractors.

Address

Total Cost

1661 Mt. Read Blvd.

$801,393.60

I have reviewed the bids for completeness and accuracy and concluded that the lowest price quote
provided by Waste Management, 1661 Mt. Read Blvd., Rochester, NY 14606 is representative of the costs
necessary to complete the project and the contractor is qualified to perform the proposed work. Therefore,
I am requesting that FASC recommend that the Town Board award the project to the low, responsible and
responsive contractor, Waste Management, for a lump sum price not to exceeded $801,393.60. I further
recommend that the Supervisor be authorized to execute any necessary change orders that do not
collectively exceed ten percent of the awarded contract price.
As always, thank you for your consideration. In the event that you have any questions regarding
this matter please contact me.
Respectfully,

The Honorable Town Board
Suzanne Zaso, Director of Finance

Charge and Credit Card Use Policy

On October 27, 2004, the Town Board adopted a charge card policy to address
the use of store issued charge cards for securing goods for Town services. This
policy did not include authorization for major credit cards. The attached
proposed policy amends the originally adopted policy by including provisions for
major credit cards and expanding on the safeguards to be taken when given the
responsibility of using either a charge or credit card issued to the Town. The
revised policy was initially reviewed by the Finance and Administrative Services
Committee at their March 18, 2014, meeting and then subsequently reviewed
and commented on by the Town’s independent auditors.
I am recommending that Your Honorable Body adopt the attached revised
Charge and Credit Card Use Policy. I would be happy to respond to any
questions that members of the Town Board may have regarding this matter.

Town of Brighton
Charge and Credit Card Use Policy

Policy Statement
The Town of Brighton will provide for the restricted use of charge cards issued by vendors
selected pursuant to the Town’s Procurement Policy as a means to expedite the purchase of
supplies, materials, and minor equipment, and to reduce the administrative effort and
paperwork typically involved with such purchases. Town charge cards may not be used for
personal expenses or other prohibited items, and must be properly safeguarded at all times
from loss or misappropriation.
The Town of Brighton may authorize a major credit card (such as VISA or Mastercard) to be
assigned to the Town Finance Department to be used for authorized purchases for which
procurement by means of a purchase order or check are not possible or for payment of vendor
claims after appropriate Town Board audit. Town credit cards may not be used for personal
expenses or other prohibited items, and must be properly safeguarded at all times from loss or
misappropriation.

Definition of Terms
Charge Card a card issued by a store that enables purchases to be made only through that
store utilizing the card and to be billed via a statement at a later date with full payment due.
—

Credit Card a major credit card such as VISA or Mastercard that is typically issued by a
financial institution enabling purchases at vendors accepting such card. Credit cards have a
revolving payment plan.
—

Prohibited Items items that are not eligible for purchase using either a Town issued charge or
credit card. These items include, but are not limited to, alcohol, tobacco, personal expenses,
and cash advances.
—

Procedures
The assignment and administration of all authorized charge cards will be determined by the
Director of Finance. For departments wishing to utilize charge cards, the Department Head

may request the assignment of a charge card(s) to their department or make use of a General
Administration card(s) maintained by the Finance Department. In all cases, Department Heads
must identify those department employees to be authorized to possess and use charge cards,
and provide the Finance Department with a listing of all such authorized employees inclusive of
the employee’s signature. When not in used, the Department Head is responsible for ensuring
that all authorized charge cards are safeguarded in a secure location.
Charge card transactions initiated for which no purchase order had been issued, or for which
sufficient funding is not provided in the department’s budget, will be considered unauthorized
and subject to review and discussion between the responsible Department Head and the
Director of Finance. Any unauthorized expenditure may result in a personal expense to the
employee.
Major credit cards are only assigned to the Finance Department and may only be utilized with
the authorization and assistance of the Director of Finance or the Budget Officer.
All charge card slips and any other supporting documentation must be retained and
subsequently submitted to the Finance Department at when the vendor’s billing statement is
received. At that time, the purchasing department will reconcile all charge slips with the billing
statement, prepare an accounting distribution for all expenditures incurred, and authorize
payment to the vendor for purchases made by their authorized department employees. In the
case of a missing receipt, every attempt must be made by the purchasing department to obtain
a duplicate receipt from the vendor. If unable to secure a receipt, a statement from the
department head authorizing the purchase should be submitted to the Finance Department
detailing the purchase inclusive of date, items purchased, pricing, and purpose. Any billing
discrepancies or concern of unauthorized use should be brought to the immediate attention of
the department head and/or the Director of Finance.

Prohibited Uses
The purchase of alcohol, tobacco, personal expenses, or cash advances through use of a Town
authorized charge or credit card is prohibited. Any such purchase will be considered a personal
expense to be recovered by the Town through whatever means the Director of Finance deems
necessary in the circumstances. Any personal use may result in the revocation of authorized
use, and the employee involved in such a purchase may be subject to progressive discipline up
to and including termination.

Card Safekeeping
All cards issued are to be kept in a secure place within the custodial department and not taken
home by any employee, accept as authorized in writing by the Department Head and the
Finance Director. Cards should only leave this secure location to make the necessary purchase
and be promptly returned thereafter. The department is responsible for keeping a log of when
the card is released to an employee. Such log should include at a minimum:

•

Name of employee the card is released to
Date and time the card is released and returned

•

Purpose of the transaction

•

Total cost of the transaction

•

A detailed receipt including vendor name, date, itemized items purchased and prices should be
obtained from the vendor and submitted to the staff member responsible for processing the
claim for payment.
Any purchase made via phone, fax, or internet using a credit card should be scrutinized for
security. It is advised that these types of transactions be performed only when necessary to a
known, reliable vendor. Internet transactions should only be processed through a secure
website.
Any employee or department that is issued a Town charge or credit card for use is responsible
for its safekeeping and must report a lost or stolen card to the Finance Department
immediately.

* ************** *********** ****** ***** ******* **** ******* ******** ** * ***** * **** * *

I,
have received and read the Town’s policy on charge and
and I agree to abide by
credit card use which was adopted by the Town Board on
all provisions of said policy.

Re:

Donation Towards Town Tree Replantings

Dear Supervisor Moehie and Town Council Members:
Mr. And Mrs. George Mackey of #199 Palmerston Road have graciously provided a donation
of $284.00 towards replanting two trees in the public right of way at that location. This will allow the
Highway Department to upgrade the size of the trees to a larger diameter caliper above what would
normally be replanted. I recommend that your Honorable Body receive and file the attached
communication and check from the Mackey’s and accept the donation, with great appreciation and
thanks, as an unanticipated revenue for the A.DPW 8560 4.11 account.
As always, thank you for your consideration of matters such as this.
Very truly yours,
