Re:

Proposed Parking Restrictions
Buckland Park Entrance Road

Dear Supervisor Moehie and Town Council Members:
As you may be aware the entrance road to Buckiand Park is used by Park visitors for the parking
of their vehicles during certain events. This has been problematic at times due to the narrowing of the
pavement, causing concern for accessibility to the area by emergency vehicles, as well as inherent safety
concerns due to pedestrian traffic along the road and between sports fields. The Parks, Recreation and
Community Services Committee is in favor of this proposal, having recommended this action at their
April 2014 meeting. Therefore, it is proposed to restrict parking in accordance with Town and Highway
Law as outlined below to nuilce the area safer and more manageable:
1)

along both the east aid west sides of the entrance road to Buckland Park, authorize no parking
at all times from the intersection of Westfall Road and 650 feet to the south, which is the
beginning of the formal parking lot;
For your reference an aerial photo depicting the above stated information is attached.

I would therefore ask that the Town Board receive and file this communication, that a public
hearing be set for this matter and that any requisite notification be sent out. As always, your
consideration of matters such as this is greatly appreciated.
Very truly yoØ,

<

property neighborhood relief act of 2014”; and to
property actions and proceedings law, in relation

amend the real
to the duty of the
property secured by

PURPOSE:

To help community residents and municipalities throughout the State
better address the growing problem of vacant and abandoned residential
properties by creating a statewide registry of such properties and
imposing a duty on mortgagees and their loan servicing agents to
report these properties to the registry and take earlier
(pre-foreclosure) action to identify, secure and maintain them.
SU*ARY OF SPECIFIC PROVISIONS:

Section 1 establishes the title of the Act as the “New York State
Abandoned Property Neighborhood Relief Act of 2014.”
Section 2 amends section 1307 of the Real Property Actions and
Proceedings Law to: create a definition of “vacant and abandoned”
residential real property; expand the existing duty of a mortgagee to
maintain vacant residential real property to include pre-foreclosure
“vacant and abandoned” residential property as defined in the bill,
and to expand such duty to the mortgagee’s loan servicing agent;
establish a periodic inspection requirement for rnortgagees and bar.
servicing agents to determine if residential real property subject to
a delinquent mortgage is currently occupied; and make it unlawful for
a mortgagee or loan servicing agent, or a person acting on their
behalf, to enter residential real property that is not vacant or
abandoned for the purpose of forcing, intimidating, harassing or
coercing a lawful occupant thereof to vacate the property in order to
render it vacant and abandoned.
Section 3 adds a new section 1307—a to the Real Property Actions and
Proceedings Law to: require the Attorney General to establish and
maintair. a statewide electronic Vacant and Abandoned Property Registry
that shall be accessible to local officials across the State; require
mortgagees or their agents to promptly submit to the statewide
Registry information about vacant and abandoned properties, including
but not limited to the current name, address and contact information
for the lender or servicer responsible for maintaining the property,
whether a foreclosure action has been filed, and any updated materIal
information when it becomes available; authorize a municipality
wherein vacant arid abandoned residential property is located to
intervene as of right in a foreclosure action involving the property
for the purpose of requesting injunctive relief to ensure the property
is maintained in accordance with law and that the foreclosure action

is timely prosecuted; require the Attorney General to establish and
maintain a toll—free hotline that community members concerned about
vacant and abandoned properties can call to report such properties and
to obtain information relating to such properties, including but not
limited to whether a specific property is listed on the Attorney
General’s statewide Vacant and Abandoned Property Registry and, if so,
the identity of the mortgagee or loan servicing company responsible
for maintaining the property; and authorize the Attorney General, and
any affected locality upon written notice to the Attorney General, to
seek injunctive relief and/or civil penalties against mortgagees
and/or their agents for violations of RPAPL sections 1307 and 1307—a.
Section 4 establishes an effective date of 180 days after the act
shall have become a law.
EXISTING LAW:

Section 1307 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law
currently requires a plaintiff in a mortgage foreclosure action who
obtains a Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale involving residential real
property that is or becomes vacant to maintain the property until such
time as ownership of the property has been transferred through the
closing of title in foreclosure or other disposition, and the deed is
duly recorded.
jUSTIFICATION:
Vacant and abandoned residential properties securing delinquent
mortgages fall into disrepair and harm neighboring properties and the
surrounding community. These properties are a blight on neighborhoods
because they are often boarded up, inhabited by squatters or used for
criminal purposes. When a vacant and abandoned property is not
maintained for an extended period of time, there is a decline in the
community’s real estate market and the state’s property tax base.
There is also an increased likelihood of crime in and around the
property. There are instances of such properties being used by
criminals to manufacture and/or distribute illegal drugs.
Municipalities are often forced to expend taxpayer funds to prevent a
vacant and abandoned property from becoming a public hazard. If a
municipality is forced to care for a siqriificant number of vacant and
abandoned properties, its oudget can be depleted quickly.
Current law, enacted in 2009, imposes a duty on piairitiff-mortgaqees
to maintain vacant residential properties only after a Juogment of
Foreclosure and Sale has been entered. Unfortunately, this law has
proven inadequate to address the growing number of vacant and
abandoned properties falling into disrepair across New York State. A
survey in one jurisdiction showed that most vacant arid abandoned
properties were not subject to foreclosure actions and, if they were,
the cases had not proceeded to Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale. In
many instances, the plaintiff-mortgagee abandoned the foreclosure
effort. In others, the plaintiff—mortgagee sought to vacate its own
Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale, bringing the property outside of trie
exIsting maintenance reuuirement imposed on the plaintiff—mortgagee by
statute. Tnere is also evidence showing that current and former New
York homeowners have been misled into believing they need to leave
their homes earlier in the foreclosure process than they actually have

to, resulting in even more vacant and abandoned properties.
In response to this growing threat to communities across New York
State, the Abandoned Property Neighborhood Relief Act of 2014 will
ensure that homeowners are provided with early notice that they are
legally entitled to remain in their homes until ordered to leave by a
court and will require mortgagees and their loan servicers and agents
to identify, secure and maintain vacant and abandoned properties much
earlier in the mortgage delinquency timeline. It will also require
that they electronically register these properties with the
newly—created Vacant and Abandoned Property Registry to be established
and maintained by the Attorney General. The Registry, in turn, will
provide a much needed and readily available source of information on
vacant and abandoned residential properties to local officials
throughout the State, and will be supplemented by a toll—free hotiine
that community residents can use to report suspected vacant and
abandoned properties to the Attorney General and receive information
regarding the status of registered properties, including the identity
of the mortgagee or agent responsible for maintaining them.
PRIOR LEGISLATIVE HISTORY:

New bill.
FISCAL IMPLIcAT:oNS:
It is expected that there will be costs to the Office of the Attorney
General for the establishment and maintenance of the statewide Vacant
and Abandoned Property Registry and the toll-free community resident
hotline established by the Act.
EFFECTIVE DATE:

180 days
