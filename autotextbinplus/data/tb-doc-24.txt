Re:

Farash Property
Proposed Trail
Prepare and solicit an RFP for Professional Design Services

Dear Councilperson Werner and Committee Members:
I am requesting authorization to prepare and solicit a request for proposals for professional services to
design a multi-use trail through the Farash property. The trail will extend from Elmwood Avenue to
Westfall Road and connect the Town Hall with Buckland Park. A schematic layout of the trail is illustrated
in the Town of Brighton’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan. A copy is attached. This layout indicates
that the proposed trail will traverse a large extent of federal and NYSDEC wetlands. Therefore, the RFP
will require that the successful bidder obtain the necessary permits and develop a design that minimizes
disruption to the wetlands in accordance with the wetland permit requirements.
Funds are available in account A. 878.Parks to perform the professional design services for the proposed
Farash property trail. Therefore, we are requesting authorization to prepare and solicit a request for
proposals for professional design services for the Farash Property Trail. No action as to awarding a
contract will be considered without returning to this committee.
As always, thanlc you for your consideration. I will be in attendance at your regularly scheduled December
30, 2013 meeting in the event that you have any questions regarding this matter.
Respectfu)Jy,
--.

Dear Ms. Graim:
I am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the thoughtful and generous donation to the
Brighton Police Department from Tops Market as part of the “Giving Campaign for the Grand
Re-Opening in Brighton.”
While it is not necessary to make direct donations to the department for services provided, your
thoughtfulness and consideration help instill a strong community-oriented attitude in our officers.
In keeping with the spirit of your donation, I have directed that the $1000.00 donation be placed
in the 2014 budget line which supports community service functions.
On behalf of the entire Brighton Police Department, I wish to thank you for your thoughtfulness
and generosity.

Respectfully,
——

Susan Wentworth, Coordinator of Data Processing
December 17, 2013
Request Town Board action to Authorize the Town Supervisor to execute
the Telecommunication System Maintenance Agreement with RelComm,
Inc. for2Ol4

The Town of Brighton’s Mitel phone system is covered under an annual support
agreement with RelComm, Inc.
The Telecommunication System Maintenance Agreement describes the warranty period
and the existing equipment to be covered for support. All pricing is on NY State contract
through 1/6/2018.
Rel Comm no longer includes the UPS Battery Backups in their maintenance
agreements. These are standard APC units where the batteries can be purchased from
any supplier so necessary replacements can be made in house as needed without
affecting the function of the phone switches. The net effect of this new agreement will
be a decrease of $22.00 from $817 to $795 per month from January 1, 2014 through
December 31, 2014.
The maintenance has been an ongoing shared expense for the following budgets:
Highway (A.HWY.51 32), Court (A.JSTCE. 1110), Police (A.POLCE.31 20), Recreation
(A.REC.7020), Shared Services (A.SSVCS.1620) and Library (L.LIBRY.7410).
This request is for authorization for the Town Supervisor to approve the attached
maintenance agreement with Rel Comm, Inc.
Thank you for your consideration.

Budget Re-Appropriation for Highway Truck

At the November 13, 2013, Town Board meeting a resolution was passed to
transfer $50,000 from road salt to trucks in the highway fund to purchase a
replacement medium duty truck. Bids were solicited and we expect an award by
the Town Board to Vision Ford in the amount of $43,442 at their January 8, 2014
meeting. Since the truck order cannot be placed until Town Board approval, the
funds budgeted in 2013 will fall to fund balance in the highway fund at year-end
2013. I am recommending that the Town Board authorize the re-appropriation of
these funds in the 2014 budget so this purchase can be made as intended.
The formal action that I am requesting of the Town Board is to re-appropriate
$43,442 in 2014 from highway fund balance to the highway machinery truck
account (D.HWY.5130 2.22).
I will be happy to respond to any questions that members of the Committee or
other members of the Town Board may have regarding this matter.

Re:

Create Full-Time Senior Network Technician Position and Authorize Recruitment

Dear Honorable Members:
In November the Town Board authorized the creation of a Network Technician position under
Information Systems in the Finance Department and authorized recruitment of same. After
interviewing candidates from the Civil Service list for this position it was determined that a
higher title and salary was necessary to secure a qualified applicant for the duties being
requested. Therefore, I am requesting that the Town Board consider creating the position of
Senior Network Technician under Information Systems.
The formal action requested of the Town Board is to create a full-time Senior Network
Technician position (at 35 hours per week) under Information Systems and to authorize
recruitment of same. It is also requested that this position be added to Group 4 of the Town’s
Non-Represented Employee Salary and Wage Schedule.
I will be happy to answer any questions regarding this matter
Sincerely,

Suzanne E. Zaso

RE:

ATTN: Mr. Ramsey Boehner

U of R SDGEIS Review

Dear Mr. Boehner:
The purpose of this letter is to provide responses to the November 22, 2013 review comment
letter, prepared by the Town and Stantec, and to transmit the Revised Draft of the University of
ochester’s
1 PD Rezoning Supplementa Draft Generic Impact Statement (S-DGEIS). Four copies of
the S-DGES are enclosed; two copies will be deHvered to Staltec.
The numbered comments below correspond to the November 22, 2013 letter; comment fo!lowed
by response.
Traffic/Transportation Network

1).

We have requested twice, as has the Town, for confirmation that the traffic counts taken
(latest 2006 and many older) are still valid. The letter from MCDOT is not enough. The
MCDOT even notes in a footnote below the table that while there was been little growth in
traffic in Monroe County, that around the U of R a 1.5% increase per year might be
expected. That is greater than the factors used by the Applicant to expand the old traffic
counts used in the latest study through the year 2013. The need for updated traffic
counts/verification has been discussed with the Applicant consultant more than once.
Some new traffic counts need to be taken while the U of R is in session to show that they
are still valid. If the counts are not valid, then all new traffic counts need to be obtained
and the traffic analysis needs to be revised to reflect the updated counts.

Response: The traffic volumes used for the analysis were compared with more recent 24 hour
counts available from MCDOT. However, with respect to your request to provide updated
traffic counts to validate the counts within the Town of Brighton, we offer the following:
New turning movement counts were obtained at the following intersections on December 3,
2013 and December 4, 2013:

As indicated in the table above, the traffic volumes established for the existing AM and PM
peak hour conditions in the U of R S-DGEIS are greater than the traffic volumes that were
recently counted during the peak hours at the three intersections studied. An expanded
version of the table with volumes for each movement is included in Appendix E of the SDGEIS.
As stated on our previous correspondence, all of the original traffic volume counts were
grown by approximately 1% to 1.2% per year to determine the Existing Conditions traffic
volumes. Using a 1.5% growth rate within the area surrounding the U of R as suggested by
MCDOT’s footnote in their April 2, 1013 Traffic Volume Trend Memo is not appropriate for
this project as new trips generated by the U of R are included in the trip generation for the
project. The additional growth rate would inflate the background traffic volumes and could
curtail mitigation associated with the U of R development. After observing the three
intersections during the AM and PM peak hours, the existing volumes used in the TIS for the
U of R SDGEIS are conservative. As previously discussed, new traffic volume counts will be
conducted when the TIS for the U of R, IPD is updated in 2015.

The Response to our September 11, 2013 comment letter states, “Since proposed
drainage conditions will result in reduced outflows and volumes from the site, a
proposed
downstream analysis was not completed”. The Drainage Report concludes that
stormwater management improvements will limit the run-off rates generated by the
proposed development to those flows generated by the existing site. However, the
longer
stormwater management facilities release the proposed peak run-off rates over a
period of time which may cause the peak flows rates from the development to coincide
with the watershed peak flow rates. The combination of these peak flow rates could
produce downstream flows that exceed the existing flows. The intent of the downstream
peak
analysis is to confirm that the proposed development does not result in an increase of
downstream run-off rates. The downstream analysis must be completed.

5).

The hydrologic model contained in the drainage calculations assumes a zero run-off release
rate from the wetland in Drainage Area 3 for the existing and proposed conditions. Over
time a zero run-off rate would cause the wetland water elevation to continually and
permanently rise until it overflowed the lowest restriction and there would no longer be a
zero run-off discharge rate. The release rate from Drainage Area 3 should be determined
based upon the lowest restriction, the high point within the existing channel along the east
side of the trail. We suggest that the Drainage Area 3 proposed condition include an outfall
pipe that maintains the existing wetland water elevation and directs the stormwater
released from the wetland area to the west side of the trail south to Furlong creek.

Page 29 states,”The post-mitigation measures were taken as the “existing conditions” for
the proposed improvements baseline analysis to ensure that the proposed development
would not retract the benefits achieved from this mitigation”. Including the post mitigation
measures will increase the existing run-off rates experienced by Drainage Area 3 which may
allow for greater proposed development discharge rates. The existing conditions should
not include the post-mitigation measures.
Response: The Drainage Report and S-DGEIS text summaries have been revised per the
comment above. Any reference to existing conditions in either of these documents refers to
pre-amenity inclusion (or current state) conditions. Section 119 of the Drainage Report shows
the ‘after amenity inclusion’ hydrologic findings.

8).

The RRv analysis should evaluate the required and provided RRv for each drainage area.
Response: A summary of the RRv calculations and results is provided in Table 10.1 of the
Drainage Report. Cakulations for the required and provided RRv are provided in Appendix C
of the Drainage Report in the worksheet entitled “Stormwater Management Planning &
Practice Selection Worksheet for New Development’ A separate worksheet is provided for
each of the drainage areas that contain development and storm water mitigation.

(

9).

The Tables labeled TSS Comparison of Pre-&Post Construction Pollutant Loading and TP
Comparison of Pre-& Post Construction Pollutant Loading indicate that the Proposed
Pollutant Loading, (Pre WQv practices) is substantially less that the Existing Pollutant
Loading. Generally the proposed conditions, pre WQv Practice result in higher pollutant
loads than the existing conditions hence, the need for WQv practices. Please confirm the
pollutant loading values included in the referenced table.
Response: The pollutant loading calculations have been revised in the calculation worksheet
found in Appendix C of the Drainage Report and in the summary Tables 11.4 and 11.5 in the
drainage report. The changes that were made were: the green area was divided into lawn
and woods/meadow and the amount of pollutant removal for practices in series was
approximately cut in half for each consecutive measure. For example, the first practice
provides 85% TSS removal. The second practice in the series would provide 80% TSS removal
but because it is second in the series a rate of approximately 40% was used. The third
practice in the series would provide 80% TSS removal but a rate of 20% was used.
The results of the calculations still showed a reduction in pollutants from existing conditions
to proposed, for Drainage Area #1. This is a result of the reduction in both drainage area and
lawn area with development. Drainage Area #2 & #3, as expected, showed an increase in
pollutant discharge with proposed conditions. Drainage Area #4 also showed a decrease as a
result of a decrease in drainage area and removal of developed areas from this area.

The calculations use the ‘Simple Method’ which determines pollutant loading by annual
runoff. Annual runoff is based on the Rv value or percent impervious. Proposed drainage
Area #4 does not contain any impervious area; therefore, it resulted in a 0 runoff value. In
actuality, it will produce a very minor amount of pollutant runoff and certainly will produce
rainfall runoff; but it will still be a substantial reduction from current conditions.
When stormwater management measures were considered, the pollutant loading for
Drainage Area #3 was less than existing conditions. Drainage Area #2 had a minor increase in
Pollutant loading with proposed conditions. This is acceptable as Drainage Area #2
discharges to the Erie Canal which is a dredged and maintained waterway system.
Page 31 states, “Alternatively 75% of the water quality volume may be provided with an
alternative practice”. Chapter 9 of the NYS Stormwater Management Design Manual
provides alternatives to the technical standards that would be acceptable for certain
redevelopment projects. When physical constraints in a redevelopment situation are
present, such as those described in Section 9.3.1, the alternative stormwater management
practices and sizing criteria presented in Chapter 9 may be used. If the alternative sizing
and selection of stormwater management controls are utilized the SDGEIS must
demonstrate that the redevelopment conditions meet the application criteria in Section
9.3.1.

10).

Response: Alternative stormwater management practices are not utilized in this design. To
avoid confusion, references to alternative uses for redevelopment have been removed from
the text of the SDGEIS and the Drainage Report.
11).

Regarding Drainage Area 3, the former drainage study stored and controlled the
stormwater discharge rate prior to the existing wetland area. It appears that the existing
wetland is being used to provide stormwater detention for the project. This practice is
generally unacceptable by the NYSDEC. Stormwater quantity control should be provided
prior to the discharge of stormwater to the existing wetland.
Response: The existing and proposed runoff rates both into and out of the wetlands have
been analyzed. Section 6 of the Drainage Report compares existing and proposed runoff
rates into the wetlands. The proposed runoff rate to the wetland is less than existing
conditions. Section #7 of the Drainage Report shows existing and proposed runoff rates out
of the wetlands.

12).

A comparison of pre developed and post developed stormwater discharge volumes should
be provided for each discharge point. If infiltration is not practical it should not be
considered as a method to reduce the volume of run-off generated by a particular area.

re:

Award of Contract
Provisions of 24/7 Answering Services for Sewer Department

Dear Chairman Werner and Committee Members:
Per price quotations received, it is recommended that an agreement be executed with Action
Telephone for the provisions of after hours answering services for one year in an amoun
t not to exceed
$750.00, expiring on December 31, 2014, with an annual option to renew for years 2015 -2017.
Funds
have been included in this year’s budget for this service. Please note that the not to exceed
contract
amount is in excess of the quoted price, which provides for some flexibility in the event
that the after
hours phone calls received are greater than that estimated in the RFQ. This particu
lar vendor has
provided quality service in prior years for incoming calls after normal working hours
and on weekends,
and has consistently performed in the capacity intended.
As always, thank you for your consideration. I will be in attendance at your regular
ly scheduled
December 30, 201 3 meeting in the event that you have any questions regarding this
matter.
Very truly yours,
