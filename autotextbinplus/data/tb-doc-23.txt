NEGATIVE DECLARATION
Notice of Determination of Non-Significance
Project Number: ER-1-14

Date: January 22, 2014

This notice is issued pursuant to Part 617 of the implementing regulations pertaining to
Article 8 (State Environmental Quality ReviewAct) of the Environmental Conservation Law.
The Town of Brighton, as lead agency, has determined that the proposed action described
below will not have a significant effect on the environment and a Draft Environmental
Impact Statement will not be prepared.
Name of Action:Crittenden Road Sidewalks
SEQR Status:

Unlisted

Conditioned Negative Declaration:

No

Description of Action: The project involves the installation of 1700 linear feet of concrete
sidewalk within the ROW of Crittenden Rd. (Monroe County jurisd iction) on the south side
of the road. Along the south side of Crittenden Rd. from the corner of West Henrietta Rd.
& Crittenden Rd. eastward approximately 1700 LF. to East Squire Dr. Property addresses
are 1711 Crittenden Rd. (148.12-2-62.12), 2400 West Henrietta Rd. (148.12-2-62.11)&
empty lot at the corner of Crittenden Rd. & East Squire Dr. (149.09-1-3.1). The Town of
Brighton is applying through the County of Monroe for CDBG funds for the project. A
permit from the Monroe County Highway Department will also be required.
Location: Between W. Henrietta Rd. & East Squire Dr. on the south side of Crittenden Rd.,
Town of Brighton, Monroe County
Reasons Supporting This Determination:
After considering the action contemplated and reviewing the Environmental
Assessment Form prepared by the applicant and the Criteria for determining significance
in the SEQR regulations (6 N.Y.C.R.R. Section 617.11), the Town of Brighton finds that the
proposed action will not have a significant impact on the environment based on the
following finding:
1.

The requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Law have been
complied with.

2.

There will be no resources of value irreversibly lost.

3.

The project construction period will be short; noise impacts from construction and
impacts upon traffic flow will be limited.

4.

Proper erosion control measures will be used. There will be no adverse impact on
the environment.

5.

The NYS Historic Preservation Office has reviewed the project and determined that

6.

Temporary and/or permanent easements may be required for the construction of
the project. The acquisition of temporary easements will be minimized in order to
restrict construction activities on private properties. Permanent easements to allow
for the construction to occur as well as to allow for future maintenance will also be
minimized. Easement areas will be restored to preconstruction condition after the
project is completed.

7.

Although the Town will attempt to avoid damage to existing trees, depending on
final alignment of the sidewalk, it may be necessary to removea tree or trees and
vegetation in the Crittenden Road ROW and/or easement areas. Options/methods
will be considered to limit tree and vegetation disturbance.

ALL SEASONS COUNTY/TOWN WORK AGREEMENT

Dear Mr.):

Enclosed, please find three copies of the Amendatory Agreement for the All Seasons County’Town Work Agreement for
2014. The original Agreement was executed by your Town/Village Board and Terrence J. Rice in 2007 and the
Agreement allows for the renewal ‘upon mutual written consent of the parties for additional one-year terms, for a
maxun urn agreement term often years.”
Also, enclosed are new Appendices A & B For 2014. Appendix A reflects the new fringe rates for 2014. As
recommended and agreed to following the work of the Fringe Rate Task Group in 2002, the maximum fringe rates
value each year will be either the Monroe County’s fringe rate or the actual town rate if less than the county rate. This
year the County’s actual fringe rate is 56.76% and the calculated fringe rate for all towns/villages exceeds the County’s
fringe rate. Therefore all towns/villages will be paid the County’s fringe rate of 56.76% for 2014.
Please have your Town Supervisor/Village Mayor authorize and sign all three copies of the Amendatory Agreements.
Kindly return all three copies to Joyce Cordeilo, Principal Permit Assistant, Monroe County Department of
Transportation, 50 West Main Street, Suite 6100, Rochester, New York 14614. Please include a Town/Village
Board Resolution as applicable.
Once all the documents are received and we have verified that the current insurance documentation currently on file (as
submitted and approved with your recent snow and ice agreement) is valid, I will execute the Agreements and return a
signed copy to you.
If you have any questions regarding this Agreement, please feel free to contact me at 753-7731.
Sincerely;

Dear Supervisor Moehie,
I have been remiss in not writing sooner. One of our board members, our current President, Kathy Miller, has come to
the end of her term.
The library board voted at our December meeting to recommend that she be re-appointed for another term. I hope that
the town board will agree and approve Kathy Miller for an additional term as a member of the Brighton Memorial
Library Board of Trustees.
Sincerely,
Andrew Kappy,
Trustee
