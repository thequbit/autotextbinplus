(1) Special Permit Public Hearing – January 7, 2015 – 7:00 P.M.
- Application No. 2014-056: 4545 East River Road, Richland
Residential, to construct 185 cottage style houses for student
housing, in an Industrial Zoned District, Tax Account No.
174.03-2-1.11.

Councilman Breese inquired about the proposed student housing project at 3860 East
River Road, the Wallman Farm property, which was approved at the October 1, 2015 Town
Board Meeting. Breese expressed concern about the viability of the Richland Residential
project if the 3860 East River Road project were to move forward and vice versa.
Supervisor Moore stated that if the Richland Residential project were to go forward, the
3860 East River Road project would probably go away. Peter Minotti, Deputy Supervisor,
stated that American Campus Communities and Landmark Properties are both still
interested in the 3860 East River Road project. Landmark Properties is waiting for the
market demographic study to come back. But the property itself at 3860 East River Road
has still not sold. Councilman Breese asked for clarification as to whether if a developer
were to purchase the 3860 East River Road, if they would need to come before the Town
Board for a Special Use Permit. Supervisor Moore felt that they would, but offered to
have the Town Attorney, Donald Young, clarify on Wednesday.

3.) Consider Authorizing Supervisor to Sign Out of District Sanitary
Sewer Contract – 632 John Street – Martin
Chris Martin, Director of Engineering & Planning, explained that the property owner of 632
John Street plans to install a sanitary sewer lateral and that the property is a single-family
residence. Councilman Mulligan asked about the possibility of bringing sanitary sewer to
the homes on Calkins & Lehigh. Martin said that he is putting together a plan that would
include per lot fees for the residents.
4.) Consider Authorizing Attendance of the New York State Building
Officials Conference – Ekwell
Terry Ekwell, Fire Marshal/Building Inspector, requested to authorization to go to
Liverpool, New York from March 31, 2015 – April 3, 2015 to meet the twenty-four (24)
hours of state mandated training for his position.
5.) Consider Authorizing Supervisor to Sign Amendatory Agreement –
County of Monroe All Seasons County/Town Work Agreement –
Eckert

2

TB Workshop January 5, 2015
This agreement is for the provision of Town labor and equipment to perform work for
Monroe County. On December 6, 2006, the Town Board authorized the Supervisor to
sign the All Seasons County/Town Agreement via Resolution #22-265/2006 for a period
from January 1, 2007 and ending on December 31, 2007, with the option of nine (9)
subsequent one-year extensions upon written consent of both parties. So the proposed
Resolution for Wednesday is to authorize the Supervisor to sign the Amendatory
Agreement for 2015.
6.) Discuss New York State Snow and Ice Agreement – Eckert
Craig Eckert, Commissioner of Public Works, explained that a Resolution was adopted in
September of 2013 for the 2014/2015 season, but it was never signed. Councilman
Mulligan asked whether everything was turned in for reimbursement and Eckert said that
it was. Supervisor Moore said that a check was received earlier that day for Middle Road
in the amount of fourteen thousand dollars ($14,000.00).
7.) Info Only: Discuss Proposed Ordinance Amending Henrietta Town
Code Section 273-6D to Allow “No Parking Any Time” on Glacier Rock
– Eckert
Eckert said that after speaking to Donald Young, the Town Attorney, he would be holding
off on this Resolution so that they could discuss it further. Glacier Rock hasn’t yet been
dedicated; they’ve only taken dedication of the stub road. Seventy feet (70’) of the road
is to the Town standard, but the driveway to the single resident who lives on the road is
one hundred forty feet (140’) down the road. Since the Town does not own that much of
the road, it hasn’t yet been determined whether assigning no parking for what the Town
does own would be beneficial to the resident on Glacier Rock. Supervisor Moore asked
whether the Town would have authority to at least put in a guardrail. Beyond this lot on
Glacier Rock is the Pittsford Town Line, so there wouldn’t be any other Henrietta lots going
into the development.
8.) Info Only: Discuss Telco Road Closing – Eckert
To update the Town Board, Craig Eckert, Commissioner of Public Works, reported that he
has signed the Order Directing Discontinuance of Telco Road, Henrietta, New York and
that it has been filed with the Town Clerk.
9.) Info Only: Discuss Fee Schedule for After School Program – Kulik
Jason Kulik, Director of Parks & Recreation, presented three different afterschool program
fee options. 2014 – 2015 payment schedule was as follows:
2014 – 2015 Payment Schedule
Total yearly fee for 5 days: $740.00 for residents and $780.00 for non-residents

Although Councilwoman Zinck was not at the meeting, she emailed Jason Kulik that she
liked Option 2. Councilman Page expressed that he also like Option 2 but is open to
discussion. Jason Kulik and Anita Tichacek in the Recreation Department also preferred
Option 2, so there was an agreement among the Town Board Members to move forward
with Option 2.

TB Workshop January 5, 2015
10.) Info Only: Discuss Update to Website – Taylor
Michele Taylor, IT Coordinator, reported that the new Town website went live today and
that she’s been going through the website to make sure that all of the links are working
properly. Councilman Page verified with Taylor that the new Code information has been
uploaded to the website. Supervisor Moore said that in addition to being available on the
website, it was also available in the Town Clerk’s Office and in the Henrietta Public Library.
11.) Consider Declaring Item Surplus Material – Henrietta Public Library –
Wiesner
The Henrietta Public Library has requested that a lateral three (3) drawer file cabinet from
1978 be declared surplus and sent to the Parks and Facilities Department for disposal.
12.) Consider Authorizing Standard Work Days for Elected and Appointed
Officials – Wiesner
Rebecca Wiesner, Town Clerk/Receiver of Taxes, explained that this was a Resolution
needed by Ruth Levey in Payroll. The proposed Resolution establishes standard work
days for employees for the New York State and Local Employees’ Retirement System.
Most of the Town Board Members were taken care of on Resolution #15-141/2013 from
August 21, 2013, but since it was prior to Councilman Breese’s appointment, he was not
part of the Resolution. The proposed Resolution establishes standard work days for
Councilman Breese and Planning Board Member Matthew Borkowski, as well as providing
general work day quantities for all Town Board Members, the Deputy Supervisor, Zoning
Board Members, Planning Board Members, and Conservation Board Members.
13.) Consider Appointing Delegate and Alternate Delegate for Association
of Towns Annual Business Meeting – Wiesner
Wiesner explained that the Association of Towns requested that the Town Board appoint
a Delegate and Alternate Delegate to send to the Association’s Annual Business meeting
on February 18, 2015 to cast the vote of the Town of Henrietta. The Town Board
Members typically leave the Annual Meeting prior to Wednesday, but decided to appoint a
Delegate and Alternate Delegate in the event that transportation delays result in them
being present.
14.) Info Only: Department of Public Works H.R. Interviews Update –
Chirdo
Barbara Chirdo, Director of Finance, reported that Driven HR is putting together a draft
report and will be coming in on Monday or Tuesday to go over the report with the
Supervisor.

TB Workshop January 5, 2015
15.) Consider Authorizing the Henrietta Foundation to Run the Driving
Range at Lookup Park – Chirdo
Barbara Chirdo explained that a new contract has already been drawn up between the
Town of Henrietta and the Henrietta Foundation. Councilman Page inquired about
insurance requirements and Chirdo assured that they were part of the new contract.
Supervisor Moore stated that the Henrietta Foundation is looking for one new net for the
driving range. Moore also expressed interest in having the Foundation pay the utility bills
for the property rather than the Town.
16.) Info Only: Lake Pamela Update – Minotti
A request for an emergency permit to stabilize the retaining wall has been on hold since
December 1, 2014, but it looks like it will be granted. Peter Minotti, Deputy Supervisor,
hoped that the Town would receive the permit by the middle of next week. Minotti
expressed gratitude for the help from Martin Janda from BME Associates on this project.
Supervisor Moore hopes to have Town employees do the work and that it be done on
frozen ground. Supervisor Moore also met with the Riverton Homeowners Association
and hopes that they will contribute to the cost of the stabilization the retaining walls at
Lake Pamela. A few years ago the Homeowners Association slated forty thousand dollars
($40,000.00) for this project and they currently have two hundred two thousand dollars
($202,000.00) in their coffers, so Moore is pressing for an answer from them.
17.) Info Only: Discuss Berm Problem – Minotti
The Town Attorney sent a violation letter to the owner of 86 Kinglet Drive about the
removal of a berm behind the house, stating that they were in violation of Planning Board
approval and PLAT map approval. The owner of the property called Peter Minotti, Deputy
Supervisor, after receiving the letter and will be coming in to Town Hall tomorrow morning
at 9:00 a.m.
18.) Info Only: Code Revisions Update – Minotti
Public Hearing dates regarding the proposed Town Code revisions have been scheduled
for Thursday, February 5th at 7:00 p.m. to discuss Sections A1 – A18 and Wednesday,
February 11th at 7:00 p.m. to discuss Sections A19 – A28. Peter Minotti explained that the
Town started this process in August of 2009 and by working on the revisions themselves,
they have saved over eighty thousand dollars ($80,000.00).
19.) Info Only: Marrano Homes Development Update – Moore
There will be a meeting next week regarding a condominium project at East Henrietta
Road and Goodburlet Road. Because they would be condominiums, all of the patio
homes would be on one (1) tax account number, instead of individual tax account
numbers. Nate Gabbert, Town Assessor, said that there is a special requirement in New
York State Real Property Law that states condominiums should be treated as if they are
