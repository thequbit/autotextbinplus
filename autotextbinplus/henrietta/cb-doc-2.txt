No Statement made:
Henrietta Conservation Board Questions for Applicant at a future Meeting:
1. There is a safety concern due to the lack of pedestrian and bicycle trails and
pathways to access outside amenities. The concern applies to both on site
and off site.
2. Confirm the green space in the 73 acre area that is part of this application.
What is the intent of the other lots that are not a part of this application?
Are the remaining acres going to remain as green space?
3. Does the application meet the standard eight (8) trees per acre? Confirm
that the access roadway acreage is included in the proposal.
4. Describe the storm water flow, confirm management practices, and what
parts of the site they will control.
5. Is the lighting dark sky compliant in order to decrease light pollution, or is it
similar to the existing lighting at nearby campus housing that has caused a
dramatic amount of light pollution?
6. Will the roadway and ponds be maintained by the Owner?
7. Application will be tabled due to the Applicant requesting late this afternoon
that they be removed from tonight's agenda.
