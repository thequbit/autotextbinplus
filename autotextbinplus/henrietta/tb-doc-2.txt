TB December 17, 2014
HUGH MITCHELL, 147 HILLSIDE AVENUE
Right, I must speak fast. Hugh Mitchell, I’m here from 147 Hillside Avenue, and I am
here representing the Rochester Regional Group of Sierra Club, which is, as you know,
is a National Environmental Organization and we’re speaking tonight about the idea that
Henrietta has an opportunity to create an exciting new park on the west side on River
Road where currently there’s a proposal by the Richland Corporation to develop the old
Kodak lands. We feel that this land is absolutely unique. It’s a beautiful, basically
nature park already, which Kodak developed. It has all amenities of a park and this
includes the Deep Swell Valley. They had trails in there, there’s old woods, there’s even
an old picnic area and especially the fact is that it’s on the west side of the Town of
Henrietta next to the river. There’s almost no public space accessible to the river, and I
think with your wise guidance from Henrietta, you have been good on developing some
parks, but I think the west side needs some park space, and there’s very little space left
along the river to develop. I would recommend, the Sierra Club would like you to see
you take leadership to try to deny the housing development next to Rivers Run and to
instead make an effort to move toward purchasing that land and it won’t cost you
anything particularly developed as a park because Kodak developed it as a park. All
those amenities are there. So the last thing I would say is that in looking over many
years at Henrietta, I’ve been at this a long time as an environmentalist, Henrietta’s
done a wonderful job. You’re a balanced community, you have commercial, you have
industrial, you have housing, you have rural. I think you need a little more park space,
and I would love to see Henrietta take action to preserve this land. Thank you very
much for your time.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you very much. The next speakers are Susan and Barry McVay.
BARRY MCVAY, 504 RIVERS RUN
We’ll go individually. I’d be glad to start off.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We have to have your name and address.
BARRY MCVAY, 504 RIVERS RUN
That’s good. Barry McVay and I live at 504 Rivers Run. Okay? So I can begin now.
That seems pertinent living at Rivers Run in that my major concerns I’d like to speak to
would have to do with our property value being impacted by this project by Richland
and BME, and then the other would be our privacy as well. In terms of, and it is
encouraging, I was listening to your earlier business about how you have been able to
get the surplus down to a reasonable level, and I am really encouraged that I have
moved almost eight (8) years ago into this community that has been so financially well
managed that we even got a refund this year, which with our surplus not being quite as
15

TB December 17, 2014
much to deal with was much appreciated. In terms of impact on the property value of
where we live, I think that it is really pertinent that this proposed project, which I
believe that you’ve gotten information from an earlier meeting this week, there were
many concerns voiced there. It would really be dramatically impacted by the student
housing development that’s being proposed and in particular, should this proposal be
put forward by the impact on the over one hundred (100) year old trees that are along
the south fence separating us from what would be the proposed development. These,
when we bought the property, the cottages that were built there, it was emphasized
that they were based on an Adirondack model. Now thinking of the model that those of
us that enjoy the Adirondacks, if they’ve moved towards, is to have the housing set
back behind those trees so that it isn’t really obvious that new housing has been
developed there, it’s in harmony with the nature of things. As was mentioned earlier,
this is just a natural, as I’m sure you all know, beautiful, environmentally unique area.
Our housing would be very compromised by a student housing as being proposed
butting right up against where our development currently is. The cottages certainly
wouldn’t be like Adirondack style in any way shape or form and the environment
surrounding them wouldn’t be in that fashion. And that ties right in to the privacy
issue. I’m especially feeling for the folks that live on the area that comes right up to
the hill where these new student housing buildings would overlook and look right down
into the cottages that would be beneath them. I think these are very significant areas
and I think that it actually could be a win/win situation to build an Adirondack like style,
in terms of both our property value and should this proposal be put forward, then the
long term value of the student housing. As somebody had mentioned from our
community, if the one hundred (100) year old trees are cut down and replaced by
evergreens and ornamental trees, by the time they grow to the height of eight feet (8’)
we’ll probably all be dead. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You’re welcome. Thank you. I’ll need your name and address too.
SUSAN MCVAY, 504 RIVERS RUN
Hi. I’m Susan McVay at 504 Rivers Run. I share a condominium with my husband, you
just heard. I have two (2) concerns about the development that’s being proposed and
they both revolve around safety. The first (1st) safety issue that I’m very concerned
about is the traffic that would be generated by this development. There’s already been
a fatal accident at the corner of Lehigh Station Road and East Henrietta Road, as you
are probably aware. That seems to be a very dangerous area. Visibility is very poor at
that intersection and I’m concerned with adding almost eight hundred (800) college
students coming through that intersection, what it would do to the safety record of that
road. I’m also concerned about the safety of the students living in that housing area.
It seems to me, as a person who worked as a Residence Hall Director for a residence
hall on the shores of Lake Ontario, that housing college students on the shores of any
16

TB December 17, 2014
body of water is a very risky endeavor. We frequently had reports and often very
concerning and valid reports of students who had either borrowed or stolen canoes or
other boats to go out onto the water at night. Kids are kids and I don’t think twenty
(20) year olds or eighteen (18) year olds have changed much, and it is a very risky
location in my mind, to house college aged young people on the shores of our river with
a very fast current in that area. I’m really concerned about that safety issue as well.
I’m concerned about the fact that, again, as I’m sure you’re aware, as the Board, the
traffic light was removed when it was no longer needed on East River Road when Kodak
went away and a light was not needed at the Kodak entrance. However, I understand
from attending the Meeting a couple of nights ago presented by the developers of this
development, that no new traffic lights are anticipated or are going to be requested to
be installed along East River Road, so I’m very concerned about the increase in traffic
and traffic flow. The other thing I learned from the developers a couple of nights ago,
is that when it was raised as a concern that there is only one (1) road, one (1) entrance
to their proposed development, they said they were also looking at trying to get a
variance to allow them to use Fairwood Drive, the only entrance and/or exit from the
Rivers Run area, in emergencies, so that then means we have one thousand (1,000)
people using the road to leave the area in an emergency. That seems like a very risky
endeavor to me. The other traffic complication that I foresee is that Rivers Run, the
large apartment building at Rivers Run, is housing, is home to the Osher Lifelong
Learning Program, which has an enrollment of six hundred (600) plus students who
come and go throughout the week. They also use that road, so now we’re up to a very
large number of people using one (1) road to get out of the area in an emergency and
an area that has been noted of course for flooding and other emergency situations, so
I’m very concerned about safety, primarily, as we look at this proposal for student
housing, and I’m sure you may share my concern about safety as well. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you very much. The next speaker is Beth VanFossen.
BETH VANFOSSEN, 501 RIVERS RUN
Thank you. I’m Beth VanFossen and I live at 501 Rivers Run, and I thank you for the
opportunity to speak and some of the prior speakers have already made some of my
points, so I will try to edit down what I have to say. As you know, Rivers Run is a
community for people over fifty-five (55), its located right next to the land that’s being
proposed as the site for student housing. I did attend the meeting two (2) nights ago
and I wish to speak briefly in opposition to the construction of this project. There are
two (2) important reasons, most important reasons I think. One is that the population
would be too dense for the land available for the housing. The acreage consists of a
hillside leading down to a wetlands area and its bounded on one side by the Genesee
River and on the other side by a two (2) lane highway, which is the East River Road.
There are two (2) aspects of this density, or overcrowding that I think should be
17

TB December 17, 2014
highlighted. One they have already mentioned is the traffic problems. Seven hundred
and eighty (780) cars located within the housing project, I’ll just add a couple of points.
This area of the road is particularly dangerous. There have been some fatal accidents,
there’s a very steep hill coming from the north, it’s fairly short. Cars come down
rapidly, in some cases, and then it goes back up again, and again the visual distance is
not very great, so it is a little difficult to anticipate the cars coming the two (2)
directions. Many of the cars seeking to getting out of the housing project would have
to cross over the southbound lane of cars and move onto the northbound lanes on the
opposite side; that is what we have to do when we leave Rivers Run and it requires
great attention as to when those cars are going to come as your trying to pull out.
Traffic on East River Road at the time that our peak hours is heavy and when the stop
lights at both ends of the region over the hills are two (2) stop lights and during peak
hours the cars line up and then when they turn green they all come down shortly
thereafter the stop light on the other side also turns green and they come, so again its
somewhat of a difficult thing, especially for people over fifty-five (55) to maneuver that.
I can only imagine what it would be like with seven hundred and eighty (780) cars,
okay they don’t all have cars, maybe six hundred (600) cars, whatever it is, seeking to
get out from the housing project. A second (2nd) aspect of the traffic problem, the
developers maintain that a second (2nd) exit from the project onto Fairwood Drive is in
the plans. It would normally be locked, they say, and opened only if there is a traffic
accident on East River Road, which would block the exit from the project. It appears to
me however that this is not an answer to the normal extensive traffic crowding that will
occur as students leave and return from their classes. The second (2nd) aspect of the
crowding and density, is that the houses to be built on the land will be very crowded
together, it appears from the site plan, and that’s because of the extensive land area at
the bottom of the hill designated for wetlands and ponds, so there’s really only the top
of the hill that is available for the houses and they appear to be very close together.
Parking is outside of the houses on the streets. Very dense housing sometimes leads to
several undesirable neighborhood characteristics, particularly noise and debris, are two
(2) of the most obvious. The developers maintain that there will be student monitors in
every house who will be policing the area after normal working hours and suggest that
if this is not sufficient to control the noise or activities levels, then we residents of
Rivers Run could call the police. One (1) thing that I left out, and I only have a little bit
more to say, but I left out about the traffic problems that Osher, which is the Osher
Lifelong Learning Institute, which has six hundred (600) members, has sponsors
between forty-five and fifty-eight (45-58) courses per term and that means forty-five to
fifty-eight (45-58) courses per week, and these have attendances between twenty (20)
people and one hundred and twenty (120) people. Those people then also exit. I just
wanted to point out that it’s not just our community, the student community, it’s this
large second (2nd) community, and then finally, about the trees on the northern edge of
the plot, which are beautiful especially in the fall, being replaced with six foot (6’) tall
evergreen trees and twelve foot (12’) tall street lamps. The cutting down is required so
18

TB December 17, 2014
that they can get all of the seven hundred and eighty (780) students into the cottages
and they need the seven hundred and eighty (780), they said at the meeting, in order
to have a breakeven point for the cost of building the buildings. The northern edge of
the planned housing is so close to the Rivers Run property that we would look right up
into the cottages. We would be lower and we would, the trees would be gone, the six
foot (6’) would be there, the street lamps that are higher would be there and then
behind that would be the two (2) story buildings to some degree. It feels like a
travesty for those of us who came to Rivers Run for the beauty of it, and a catastrophe
to our hopes and dreams we had when we purchased our cottages at Rivers Run. And
should we wish to sell our houses to move to more peaceful and attractive
neighborhoods, we would find that the value of our houses might be greatly reduced. I
asked if they had considered in there, they had done much consideration and
preparation, if they had looked at the effect it would have on housing values and I don’t
think that they had. I agree with Hugh Mitchell, it would be ideal if that could be
turned into park land, I don’t know if that fits with your needs and wishes for this area.
If not, myself, I would prefer the industrial park type buildings to be built. Many of
them in this area are pleasant, they’re not huge, they’re not seven hundred and eighty
(780) employees in the buildings, you know the ones I’m talking about, in the new
industrial park. That would be preferable, in my view, to the creation of overcrowded
population of students. Public river front lands are rare; any natural areas should be
preserved, and I’ve used up my time I think. Thank you very much.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. The next one is James Galvin.
JAMES GALVIN, 1303 RIVERS RUN
Hello. My name’s James Galvin, I live at 1303 Rivers Run, and I only come tonight to
talk to the Board about looking very carefully at this project. It’s asked for a Special
Use Permit as well as it needs variances because the setbacks are not within the Town
Code, to allow the number of buildings that are being built. I would encourage the
Board to look at that, not as a single setback issue, but rather one (1) for every unit
that requires that setback. And if you look at a development that’s going to perhaps
require one hundred or one hundred and fifty (100 – 150) variances, I think you need
to ask yourself if it’s going to be…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
One thing you need to understand, the Zoning Board is the one that can grant
variances, the Town Board can’t.
JAMES GALVIN, 1303 RIVERS RUN
That’s true, but the Town Board does look at the project as a whole and can talk to the
Zoning Board too. The second (2nd) thing is the density is enormous on that property,
19

TB December 17, 2014
and they’ve used just about every piece of the buildable land that there is, although
they say there is green space, it is wetlands that they can’t build on. I would
encourage, if this does go through, that the development is pulled away from the
ridgeline of that property so that it maintains a visual perspectives that is not crowding
a whole line of very close built homes on the top of the ridgeline. I would also
encourage that in addition to the six foot (6’) pine trees that are proposed to replace
the trees they take down, that some kind of permanent noise abatement, a manmade
noise abatement facility would be there so that in the interim while those trees grow up
to take the natural noise abatement down, that the sound barrier would be there for
those of us who should have peaceful enjoyment of our property. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You’re welcome.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Can I just ask you what you have in mind for that, I mean do you have a…
JAMES GALVIN, 1303 RIVERS RUN
Yes, well…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…visual of what you’re…
JAMES GALVIN, 1303 RIVERS RUN
…a visual could be…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…suggesting?
JAMES GALVIN, 1303 RIVERS RUN
…even something as, like they would put on the side of a road while it would, the trees
would be there, that it could buffer that, but it would be a solid buffer that would be
high enough, perhaps create a military horizon, so that the people below it would not
see as much of the light pollution that would be there and with seven hundred and
eighty (780) students in a fifty-eight (58) acre parcel, the noise abatement could be
reduced significantly by something like that that would take probably twenty (20) years
for the trees to do.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Thank you.
