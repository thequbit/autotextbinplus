Application Reviews

Application No. 14-001

Residence Inn- For review of final site plan approval of
a 4-story hotel tower on an existing 12.1 acres of land
located at 1300 Jefferson Road in an Industrial Zoned
District. Tax Account No. 162.07-1-5.1.

Representing Applicant:

Matthew Oates, P.E., Benderson Development Company

A.

The Applicant stated the following:
1. Revising the existing Marriott Residence Inn Suites with additions and
alterations.
2. There will be sheet drainage that flows north to the existing storm pond.

B.

The storm pond is considered a New York State DEC wetland.
All lighting will be flat glass and dark sky compliant.
North 2/3 of property will stay undeveloped as green space.
South (front) will be seeded and maintained after removals.
Net reduction in rooms.

Henrietta Conservation Board recommends to the Planning Board:
1. Planting plans (demolition versus new) are not consistent.
2. Verify that tree plantings along the pond are shown in correct locations.
3. Sixty-four (64) trees will be added, which would normally be less than
eight (8) trees per acre; however, only four (4) acres are being
developed, and thus it is sufficient.
4. Recommend planting east side landscape screening near swale to block
view of the neighbor.
5. Recommend delineating wetland at the one hundred foot (100’) buffer
utilizing signs and/or pines.

Representing Applicant:

Adam Freeman, LandTech Surveying & Planning, PLLC

A.

The Applicant stated the following:
1. Existing business in Town moving to a new location.
2. Parking quantity is over what is required by Code due to training
requirements of user.
3. There is an excess of soil stored on the site that will have to be removed.
4. Federal wetlands are in the middle of the property, but the site engineer
believes that the soil pile may have contributed to trapping the water.
5. Stormwater design will utilize bio-retention methods and flow into the
existing storm pond. Original pond was sized for the entire area, including
adjacent lots.
6. Grading will occur to correct the effects of the nearby construction. Then
a new wetland will be created per Army Corps requirements in an effort to
mitigate and also create an area for wildlife.

B.

Henrietta Conservation Board recommends to the Planning Board:
1. Test bores should be taken to make sure soil is useable for construction of
filter strips and building foundations.
2. Recommend consolidating earthwork to reduce erosion and drainage
effects on storm water system.
3. Recommend storing and testing wetland soil separately, and consider
reusing in the new wetlands if reusable.
4. Recommend oil containment in structures serving the trench drain at the
two (2) submerged loading docks.
5. Given the condition of the parcels, the work appears to be an
improvement to the property.
