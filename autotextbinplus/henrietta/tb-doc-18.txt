SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is there anybody in the audience that would like to speak on any Agenda items tonight?
John? Please state your name and address, please.
JOHN SCHMITT, 139 CAMPFIRE ROAD NORTH
John Schmitt, 139 Campfire Road North. Little picky tonight, you’re going to vote on a
Resolution passing Code of Ethics. On the print out that I got from the Internet on
your program tonight, you are, on the Resolution just before that is where you are
going to authorize Mrs. Chirdo to attend the New York State Public Employer Relations
thing. I have no problem with that, okay. What my problem is that at the very, you
start off by introducing her as the Director of Finance. The very last statement on it
says, “BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that all properly prepared vouchers are submitted to
the Finance Department for reimbursement.” That just sounds a little bit like, I don’t
think it would pass an internal auditor coming in.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Normally it would say to the Finance Director and she, and then I’m going to have to
okay it.
JOHN SCHMITT, 139 CAMPFIRE ROAD NORTH
Just, well people read, they draw conclusions, so make your motion say that it will be
submitted to the Town Supervisor and then you’re away from it. I just want to say that
whenever procedures are coming out, if you adopt this Code of Ethics, you’re going to
have to keep the wording and things very much in mind, from the top to the bottom.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
That’s why you’re on the Code of Ethics Board.

How are you tonight?
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
I just picked up the Agenda and I see…
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Name and address.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Oh, I’m sorry. Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive. I see on the Resolution, Wal-Mart is
looking to use some of their parking lot to sell some of their goods. I think, it’s one of
the Resolutions, okay you looked, okay nevermind. Anyways, I just want to say I’m
against it. Enough traffic problems, the parking lot’s usually full, not that I’d ever shop
there, but you go by there and their parking lot’s usually full. Against their selling any
of their products outside and there’s plenty of local businesses around this town that
sells the same kind of product, so no need for them to set up outside. If they want to
sell, they have a store to sell it in front of, or inside of. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thanks, Mike. Is there anybody else? (Pause, no response) The first thing we have is
I need the approval of the Minutes from the June 4, 2014 Meeting.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN

SUPERVISOR MOORE
We have a Public Hearing tonight on 3012 East Henrietta Road for a property cleanup.
Would Mr. Ekwell please come to the microphone and tell us what the particulars are,
please.
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL/BUILDING INSPECTOR
The Resolution was passed at the last monthly meeting, or at the last Town Board
Meeting, indicated the conditions of the property at 3012 East Henrietta Road. Just to
reiterate, the property was involved in a major fire in July of 2000 with extensive
structural damage inside the building with floor loss. It’s been uninhabitable since that
time. We’re starting to see some more deterioration on the structure itself now where
the roof is starting to give way to the elements over the last few years. I’ve seen some
sizing where the building is beginning to lean a little bit. There’s been some issue with
people being able to get into the building, because it hasn’t been able to be secure.
And being as close to the road as it is, and with the weather conditions we’ve had in
the last couple years, last night for example, I’m really concerned about having the
building fall into the road as it’s only about thirty-five feet (35’) from West Henrietta
Road. So on those conditions, the Resolution was made, the letter was sent to Ms.
Sara Burton, who is the owner of the property and she was informed of the conditions
and she’s here tonight.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, thank you. Is the owner of the property here? Could you please come to the
microphone. State your name and your address please.
SARA BURTON, 5528 HOLLEY BYRON ROAD, HOLLEY, NEW YORK
Sara Burton, 5528 Holley Byron Road, Holley, New York.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. Do you understand why you’re here tonight, because we are seeking to
have your building demolished.
SARA BURTON, 5528 HOLLEY BYRON ROAD, HOLLEY, NEW YORK
Yes, sir.

3

TB June 18, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, and we have three (3) bids that we solicited to have it demolished and we,
because of safety reasons, we would like to go ahead and do that. Do you have any
objection to that?
SARA BURTON, 5528 HOLLEY BYRON ROAD, HOLLEY, NEW YORK
No, sir.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, will you be able to pay for that?
SARA BURTON, 5528 HOLLEY BYRON ROAD, HOLLEY, NEW YORK
I don’t know what your bids are, so I have no idea how much it is.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, I think the low bid was Frederico at like twenty-three five ($23,500.00) or
twenty-three four ($23,400.00).
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Twenty-three six ($23,600.00) wasn’t it?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Twenty-three thousand, five hundred and forty dollars ($23,540.00).
COUNCILMAN PAGE
For the people in the audience, we’re talking about the Pontillo’s Pizza site next to
Domenico’s on East Henrietta Road. I know people, I can read your faces; what are
they talking about?
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
What town do you live in again?
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Holley.
SARA BURTON, 5528 HOLLEY BYRON ROAD, HOLLEY, NEW YORK
I actually live in Clarendon, but the mailing address is Holley.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Okay, thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Because the fire was in 2000 and the building has been empty and dilapidating ever
since, so it’s to the point it’s a safety issue.

Thank you for coming in.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is there anybody else in the audience who would like to speak on this at this Public
Hearing? (Pause, no response) I would deem the Public Hearing closed and could I
have a motion?
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Mr. Supervisor, I move that we determine the property at 3012 East Henrietta Road be
a public nuisance and therefore be demolished and that 1) the Town shall authorize
said demolition be contracted and the cost paid out of general Town funds; and 2) the
Town shall be reimbursed for the cost of said demolition by assessment and levy upon
the parcel of land known as 3012 East Henrietta Road; 3) the expenses so assessed
shall constitute a lien and charge on the property known as 3012 East Henrietta Road
until paid or otherwise satisfied or discharged and shall be collected in the same
manner and at the same time as other Town charges.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. At this time we have a special happening here at Town Hall. Our Town
Hall is celebrating its 50th birthday and our Town Historian is here, Tina Thompson, and
along with a representative from Harry Bronson’s office for a little declaration.
ALLAN RICHARDS, REPRESENTATIVE FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER HARRY BRONSON
Good evening, my name is Allan Richards and I’m here on behalf of representing
Assemblymember Harry Bronson who is in Albany. I’d like to thank the families of
Henrietta, the Town Board, and the Supervisor for inviting Harry to be here tonight and
believe me, he’d much rather be here than in Albany, but you don’t always get a choice.
Harry would also like to thank Tina Thompson, the Town Historian, for encouraging
others to learn and appreciate the history of Henrietta. As we all know, we move
forward by knowing where we’ve come from. So understanding the history of Henrietta
is a wonderful thing to present to folks. So without further ado, and on behalf of Harry
Bronson and Senator Gallivan, I’d like to present this legislative resolution by Member of
Assembly Bronson and Senator Gallivan commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the
Henrietta Town Hall in Monroe County, New York.
WHEREAS, it is the sense of this Legislative Body to support the preservation and
commemoration of historic landmarks which express and preserve the social and
cultural origins of this great State of New York, and
WHEREAS, attendant to such concerns, and in full accord with its long-standing
traditions, this Legislative Body is justly proud to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of
the Henrietta Town Hall in Monroe County, New York, and
WHEREAS, June 14, 1964 marked the first time in Henrietta’s history a building
was erected for a Town Hall; the new building housed the Town offices, a meeting
room, Supervisor’s office, conference room, and the Town library, and
WHEREAS, the construction of a building in its historic perspective symbolizes
the will, the circumstances and the resolve of a people and a community, and
WHEREAS, in recognition of Henrietta Town Hall’s rich history and enduring
contribution to the heritage of the State of New York, it is the intent of this Legislative
Body to join in the celebration so that the present and future generations may come to
appreciate the unique significance which its history played in the progression of the
State and the Nation’s evolution.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that this Legislative Body pause in its
deliberation to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Henrietta Town Hall in Monroe
County, New York, to be celebrated June 18, 2014, and
6

TB June 18, 2014
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this Resolution, suitably engrossed,
be transmitted to the current stewards of the Henrietta Town Hall.
And on behalf of the Senators and all of the people of the State of New York, I’d like to
present this Resolution to the Town Historian on behalf of the families. Thank you so
much for having us here. Congratulations!
TINA THOMPSON, TOWN HISTORIAN
Thank you so much.

(Applause)
TINA THOMPSON, TOWN HISTORIAN
Thank you very much. I am delighted to accept this Resolution on behalf of all of the
residents of this community. Please convey our gratitude to Assemblyman Bronson and
Senator Gallivan for this wonderful recognition. When the construction of this building
was completed in the summer of 1964, it was an important accomplishment, not just
for Supervisor Don Cook and the Members of the Town Board, but also for the residents
of the Town. It was a symbol that Henrietta was growing and thriving. Supervisor
Cook envisioned this building as a civic center and indeed it was, especially when the
library was located in the west wing. However, in 1979, when the library had outgrown
its space and moved across the parking lot to its own building, other Town offices,
which had also grown, were more than ready to fill the space; another indication of
how Henrietta was continuing to grow and thrive. Yet the most important part of our
Town Hall is the people who work here. Residents of our community look to you, to the
Members of the Town Board, to the Town Department Heads and their staff for help
with licenses and passports, assessments, afterschool programs, zoning regulations,
and many more things than I can mention this evening. This building is located in the
geographic center of our Town, but you are its heart. Thank you.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Very nice.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, Craig Moffitt.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. 81 Finnegan Way. I did talk to Leann
earlier and ask her if I could just submit this letter, but she said I have to read the
whole letter in public to make it part of the Minutes and a part of the official Record.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You have two (2) minutes.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Dear Janet and all Town Board Members, here is the timeline over the last four (4)
years of my pursuit of concrete gutter repair at my home driveway entrance: emails
and phone calls to the Henrietta Highway Superintendent, appointment Youngman at
the time, no response; email and phone call to Mike Yudelson, no response; another
phone call and email to Mike Yudelson, highway guys come out and paint off the road
to do the repairs to the gutter, work not done; in person visit to Craig Eckert at his
office about water problems in the neighborhood as well as discussion about the
concrete gutters; in person visit to the Conservation Board looking at maps and water
issues in the entire area; no response in a timely fashion to my complaints or follow up
back to me by the Highway Department; another email to Craig Eckert, unsatisfactory
response, no guarantee of work to be done or timeline to complete; two (2) more
emails, which you all have seen now, I think except for three (3) of you, and are now
currently duly notified as of June 18, 2014. I have my signature here and my neighbor
Al Riaz, too. Would you like this?
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Thank you.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thanks.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Mr. Eckert…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Craig, yeah, I was just…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Mr. Eckert, please tell us when this is going to be done.
16

TB June 18, 2014
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yeah, if you’ve had a chance to look at it and if it’s slated to be done.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Good evening, Craig Eckert, Commissioner of Public Works. I have it on schedule for
some time hopefully before fall. It is a cosmetic repair to the gutter and when I
received notice of it back in 6/2 is the first email that I have regarding a gutter issue. I
do not have any other emails or communication besides that from Mr. Moffitt regarding
the gutter.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
With this being the middle of June, can we be assured this be done by the end of
August? This has been going on for years.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We’ll look into it and we’ll fit it in one way or another.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thanks, Craig.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Mike Stafford.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive. I was going to ask about trying to get Essex Drive
paved. It’s well traveled and the current pavement is breaking up in areas and now I
understand that they plan in the next two (2) weeks to, you do the oil and stone
routine. And since I’ve heard a lot of information that there was some cars damaged
by the oil and stone that they put down yesterday over on, I think it was Middle Road
or near Middle Road, I heard a lot of cars were damaged, and I don’t think, 1) I don’t
think we want oil and stone. I don’t know why they don’t just pave the road like they
should, like we should and go from there.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
First thing is it’s much more cost effective when we have I think a hundred and ten
(110) miles of Town road to do and we try to get over it over a ten (10) year period
and each road has been classified and I don’t know where your road is in the schedule.
You say it’s going to be oil and stone, you’re referring…
17

TB June 18, 2014
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
So I was told.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yeah, you’re referring to the project by the County of Monroe on Middle Road
yesterday.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It was done by the Town of Rush with Henrietta’s assistance. They had completed the
job at 2:00 and opened the road back up and we got that microburst or storm that
came through…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…and the oil more or less rose to the top of the stone. It did damage numerous cars of
which the company that put the oil down, Suit-Kote, is responsible for and will take care
of and they are saying that in thirty-five (35) years of doing this process on many
roads, it’s a very cost effective way of doing it. The Middle Road from Erie Station to
the Town Line was done last year and didn’t have this problem, but because of the way
the rain came, that oil came to the top and there was numerous cars that had tar on
them. Our crews went back out at 3:30, under the direction of Commissioner Eckert
and we re-stoned that road and rolled it and got it to a point that it was back in shape
and it’s a process that’s very common throughout all the northeast of putting some type
of pavement on top of a road.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay, well, much rather have it paved than stoned.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, but it’s going to cost, I would guess…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Yeah, but you’re going to have to do it probably more often than if you paved it.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Craig, could you speak to that, please?
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yeah, because there’s, you got a whole program with the oil and stone, slurry seal,
18

TB June 18, 2014
paving, what’s, how’s that all come together?
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Mostly it’s due to budget.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You have to talk into the microphone though.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Craig Eckert, Commissioner of Public Works. The oil and stone, slurry seal, are all
different treatments depending on what kind of level the service the road has now.
Based off what I’ve garnered, every road throughout the Town of Henrietta, I’ve given
it a level of service: A, B, C or D, and then justify that to the amount of expense cost to
do a surface treatment versus mill and pave, slurry seal, or oil and stone, or NovaChip,
which is the other process we’ll be using this year, which are basically the whole gamut
of facilities that are allowed to us at this point. A chip seal will possibly hold off four (4)
to five (5) years. On that street, Essex?
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Essex.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
A very minimal side street and it’s a subdivision, not really any collector traffic, it should
hold up even a little bit longer versus a street that has even more traffic, collector, side
street, subdivisions connecting.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And the cost difference between paving and the year life expectancy?
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Right now the estimate is about a dollar twenty-five ($1.25) per square yard for oil and
stone. And again, hopefully four (4) to possibly six (6) years on this kind of street for
that kind of treatment is pretty general.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Compared to paving?
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Paving is about six dollars ($6.00) per square yard. A slurry seal is approximately two
fifty ($2.50) per square yard.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
So it’s a big difference.

19

TB June 18, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You can see, Mike, why, with the amount of roads we cover.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
How long is the paving good for?
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Possibly about eight (8), because even after…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
About double, okay.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
…eight (8) years we want to either put an oil and stone or a slurry seal to get us back
up to twelve (12) or so, because pavement has a ten (10) year life expectancy.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Your road may actually see closer to nine (9) years with a mill and pave just because
again, lower traffic volumes.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
There’s more or less a formula and the roads are analyzed every year and we tried to
do it as cost effectively as possible. The total road program that you propose for this
year, dollar wise, is how much?
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Well over budget. (Laughter)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We don’t want to hear that.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
But what does that mean? Equals, what’s the answer?
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
I guess I don’t have that dollar figure…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Oh.
20

TB June 18, 2014
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
…in front of me at the moment. I know that there’s, I’m just going to put figures in.
There’s three hundred thousand dollar ($300,000.00) budget to blacktop with the
Town. There’s two hundred and twenty ($220,000.00) in chips with another, I think it
was seventeen thousand ($17,000.00) that was added with the extreme recovery
project. And then on top of that there’s a hundred and ten thousand ($110,000.00)
slurry seal budget and thirty thousand ($30,000.00) in NovaChip.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We’re talking six, seven hundred thousand dollars ($600,000.00 - $700,000.00)…
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Yes.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…in road improvements every year.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Correct. That we try to do in three (3) months.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And we have to spread that over a hundred and ten (110) miles of road.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Forgive me sir, a hundred and twenty-six point five (126.5).
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
To be specific.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
We did have a significant workshop on that and we discussed this in its entirety. The
other thing is by going with the cheaper one, we can do many more miles, so the cycle
goes around quicker.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right, but you have to do it, right...
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Right.

21

TB June 18, 2014
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
…over and over. And then I just have one quick other question…
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Sure.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
…and it had to do with milling. Guy I work with, and I know it’s a private road, that
Silvarole Trucking Road, it’s a private drive. I understand that the Town was milling
that this week. That’s what I…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
No, I believe maybe we were hauling millings in there, but we weren’t milling it. We
were actually milling East River Road under a contract with the County of Monroe. We
did it from Bailey to…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
So there was, because we were told we couldn’t go in that property at one time
because it was a private road and then so then according to him, according to him he
saw milling over there. So you say there was no milling?
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN

(Inaudible)

SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yeah, Mr. Eckert could address that.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
A lot of exercise tonight.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I hope we’re not…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
That’s my last one too.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Hi, Craig Eckert, Commissioner of Public Works. As I understand it, there was a request
to do a patch for the Fire Department that uses a pad back there to do their testing, the
volunteer Fire Department. I do not actually know if that was done this week. It was
on schedule, but yes, because of the East River project, that’s where we were set up to
mill and prepare to pave for the county contract.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
There was nothing like the whole road done?
22

TB June 18, 2014
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
No. No, it was, the only thing that was requested was a small patch, ten foot by five
foot (10’ x 5’) type of section. That was a small repair that was requested. I do not
know if it was completed as of this week. I could check with Chuck Marshall and find
out.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
That was in cooperation with the Henrietta Fire Department?
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Correct. The volunteer Fire Department, not the paid.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
What are they going to do for us?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Protect your house.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
They keep us safe.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Put my house out if it catches fire.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Hopefully you don’t need them.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Again, it was just a request, I don’t know if it’s been approved or if it’s been worked on.
It’s the only thing that I’m aware of as far as any work…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Chuck had talked to me about it, yes.
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay.

23

TB June 18, 2014
CRAIG ECKERT, COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
Thank you.

COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK

celebrate Town Hall’s birthday. Thank you.
