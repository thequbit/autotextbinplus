Storm water flows to the east into an off parcel swale.
The soil balance is even.
The exterior lighting is dark – sky compliant.
The first storage building will have climate control; the remainder storage
buildings will just have lighting.
Henrietta Conservation Board recommends to the Planning Board:
1. Add tree protection notes to (3) ash trees located in the southwest corner
of the site.
2. Consider adding more trees to meet the HCB standard of eight (8) trees
per acre. HCB is agreeable to substituting shrubs in this instance due to
security concerns.
3. The storm water for this project is handled off site and the applicant
stated it is not able to handle the next parcel’s storm water.
4. If the parcel to the east is developed, then storm water for that lot must
be addressed.
