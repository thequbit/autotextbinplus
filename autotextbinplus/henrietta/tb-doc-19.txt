SUPERVISOR MOORE
The first thing on the Agenda is a Public Hearing for the proposed rezoning of
approximately twenty-two point three four (22.34) acres of land from Residential R-1-

TB June 4, 2014
15 to Industrial on the east side of John Street. Is there somebody here to represent
the Applicant?

(From audience, Betsy Brugg, Woods Oviatt Gilman LLP, “Thank you very much, Mr.
Supervisor, Members of the Board. Is this on?”)
JENNIFER LEE, DEPUTY TOWN CLERK/RECEIVER OF TAXES
It should be on.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It should be turned on.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
I think you turned it off. It should be a switch, right?
COUNCILMAN PAGE

BETSY BRUGG, WOODS OVIATT GILMAN LLP

Take it right out of there, yeah.
BETSY BRUGG, WOODS OVIATT GILMAN LLP
Okay. Alright?
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Yes.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Name and…

TB June 4, 2014
BETSY BRUGG, WOODS OVIATT GILMAN LLP
Thank you very much. For the Record, my name is Betsy Brugg, I’m an attorney with
the firm of Woods Oviatt Gilman. With me tonight is Rich LeFrois and I’m here in
connection with his application for rezoning. The property we are talking about is some
land on John Street on the east side, twenty-two point three four four (22.344) acres.
There’s no current development proposal, however we are seeking rezoning from R-115 to Industrial, which is essentially consistent with the adjacent zoning and the type of
development that currently exists on John Street. Mr. LeFrois is working on another
project on the west side of the street. There’s nothing residential in the immediate area
and let’s see, we were at the Planning Board last week to seek their advisory
comments. They had no objections and were satisfied with the proposed rezoning. It
is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. As the Board knows, zoning must be
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Figure four dash one (4-1) of the 2003
Comprehensive Land Use Plan, as updated in I think 2010 if I’m not correct, I don’t
have my copy with me, really recognized that the extension of John Street would
happen and that would provide wonderful suitable property for industrial and office type
developments. So this is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. It’s a relatively
straightforward proposal and we request that the Board rezone. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Any questions from the Board?
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Through you, Mr. Supervisor, to build it out either Betsy or Rich, how many square feet
of building would you have in there when it’s built out?
RICH LeFROIS, LeFROIS BUILDERS & DEVELOPERS
I would say approximately a hundred and twenty-five to a hundred and fifty thousand
square feet (125,000 s.f. – 150,000 s.f.). Probably in that hundred and twenty-five
thousand square foot (125,000 s.f.) range.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
And it would all be flex space where there’d be some warehouse, some office?
RICH LeFROIS, LeFROIS BUILDERS & DEVELOPERS
Yes.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Anybody else?
COUNCILMAN PAGE
No, we’ve had an opportunity to study this and discuss it and I think it’s a very

appropriate request.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is there anybody in the audience that would like to speak on this Application? (Pause,
no response) Seeing none, I’ll close the Public Hearing. Thank you for your
presentation…
BETSY BRUGG, WOODS OVIATT GILMAN LLP
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…and we’ll move on with our Board Meeting. May I have the first Resolution, please?

CHRIS MARTIN, DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING & PLANNING
For the Record, my name is Chris Martin, I’m the Director of Engineering & Planning for
the Town of Henrietta. Typically, Bill, these are for the landscaping reviews for
Planning Board type items, like a site plan or a subdivision. And for the landscaping
ones, they vary anywhere from about three to four hundred dollars ($300.00 - $400.00)
per review. So if we have roughly around twenty (20) reviews, it would be about that
much.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Okay, thank you.
CHRIS MARTIN, DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING & PLANNING
Yes, you’re welcome.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
That concludes the Resolution part of our Meeting. We have one individual signed up
to speak on public comment and that would be Gladys Hargrave. Could you please
come to the microphone?
GLADYS HARGRAVE, 3833 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
My name is Gladys Hargrave-Reeves. I am here to apologize for the last meeting that I
was at. The feelings were very, very high and I wanted to apologize for anything that I
may have said or done that was inappropriate and especially to Mr. Page. The feelings
were very high and they still are and I think one of the reasons that they are so high is
that we are afraid of losing our group of women that have somehow found a way of
getting along with each other and bringing some wonderful things to the Henrietta
Senior Citizen Center. I don’t attend that much, but when I do go I see them getting
along and if anybody knows how wonderful it is when you can get a bunch of women to
work good together, that’s amazing. It truly is. I can speak of one of them that I know
very well and I don’t think I would be out of line for calling her name, because she’s like
a daughter to me to be honest with you. What you see with me is what you get. I
don’t try to be someone that I’m not. And the one person in particular that I know very
well is Mrs. Leonard. I’m not sure if the Board understands that we are very, very
fortunate to have her working with us. When I say us I mean the older people. She
has been a business owner successfully and a co-business owner successfully. She is
college educated, she’s a mother, her children went to Rush-Henrietta. I’m so afraid
that we’re going to lose what we have there. Shelly, on the other hand, was smart
enough to hire her and I’m very pleased about that. And again, I will apologize to
anybody that I offended, but I feel very strongly about Henrietta when I said that I’m
willing to do anything to make Henrietta a better place to live. I’m here. It doesn’t
matter who’s a Republican, who’s a Democrat, or whatever. I’m here to help. And I
think the people that know me, there are people here that have known me for a lot of
years and I think that they will say what I’m saying is true. So that is what I’m here for
and I do thank you for your work. I truly do, because I think that when all is said and
12

TB June 4, 2014
done, you’re here for one reason and one reason only and that is to make Henrietta a
better place. And I thank you for that. And I am apologizing again if I said something
that was out of line, but I am afraid that we are going to lose the people that we have
there and I would hate to see that happen. So thank you for your time.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Thank you.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. There’s also one other person that signed up and it’s, I can hardly read the
writing, Bergitta Van… if you can say your name, I’m sorry.
BIRGITTA VARANDANI, 28 DEBRAN DRIVE
Birgitta Varandani. That’s not an easy one.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
If you just give us your name and address and if you talk into the microphone so the
other people can hear.
BIRGITTA VARANDANI, 28 DEBRAN DRIVE
I’m… can you hear me?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yeah.
BIRGITTA VARANDANI, 28 DEBRAN DRIVE
I’m Birgitta Varandani and I’m here tonight, first I wanted to say thank you…

(Unidentified from audience, “Put your face right by the microphone, because we can’t
hear you.”)
BIRGITTA VARANDANI, 28 DEBRAN DRIVE
Okay. I’m here tonight, first I wanted to say thank you for voting no for a casino here.
It was a wise decision and it remains to see what the parcel of land will be used for in
the future and we’ll have to keep our eyes and ears open. Now I’ve come here to
propose a business instead that would bring construction jobs and other jobs later to
the area and that I think would fit much better for Henrietta. And that is a company
called Ikea. It’s a store, I-K-E-A, Ikea. And I don’t know if anybody here is familiar
with it.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Oh yeah.
13

TB June 4, 2014
COUNCILMAN BREESE
Very familiar with it.
BIRGITTA VARANDANI, 28 DEBRAN DRIVE
You do. How about anybody here? Put your hand up. It’s a store that started basically
like Wegmans by one person and it’s now worldwide. And it has anything you need for
your home and that includes the kitchen sink. But the closest store is in Canada. So
you have a Passport or you have a special driver’s license and it takes two and a half
(2-1/2) hours to get there and then you have to get over the bridge coming back. And
you can sit there for one to one and a half (1 – 1-1/2) hours. Closest one in the US is
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; takes four (4) hours to get to. There’s one in New York
City, etc., etc. But, I think Henrietta would be a good place. We have a good uptake
area for them and we have the Thruway, we have exit forty-six (46) and we have I-390
that goes down to Corning. We have a (inaudible) parkway which connects at I-390 at
Dansville and it’s one and a half (1-1/2) hours to Syracuse and one (1) hour to Buffalo.
Plus, we have eighty thousand (80,000) students or more that come here regularly.
Some of them come from abroad and they all need things. And above and beyond
that, they have a very nice cafeteria with good food and with coffee and pastries I can
recommend. (Laughter) And it would be good for jobs. It would be good and safe
and steady jobs for people and also it would bring people in and they would stay here,
overnight probably, and they would go to the other stores in the area and we have all
kinds for them to do, like the Play Museum, Genesee Country Village, the vineyards,
etc., etc. So I think that would be very nice for this area.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
I would have to agree. When we went through, when Wilmorite was redoing the
Marketplace, they lagged; they didn’t announce who was coming into those two (2)
new locations and the amount of people who came up to me and said, “Boy, I hope it’s
Ikea,” was several…
BIRGITTA VARANDANI, 28 DEBRAN DRIVE
I know very well.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
…so it’s certainly a well-run organization and it would be certainly an asset.
BIRGITTA VARANDANI, 28 DEBRAN DRIVE
I think that it would be very nice for Henrietta and I think they would be interested if
they knew sort of the possibilities with it. And also, I think we’d all like it frankly. So
please consider it and last time I heard, well that was a few years ago, it was the store
in Philadelphia that sort of dealt with the development of stores in the US. I don’t know
if that is still happening, but their, the main office sort of was in Sweden in a small
place, so I’m sure that that can be managed.
