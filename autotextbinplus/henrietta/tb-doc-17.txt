Works, for his due diligence on this project. The Department of Public Works Building
was built in 2001 and it has not had a backup generator, so this will help in an
emergency.

Chuck has put it in the budget every year though.

And Bill’s taken it out.

Henrietta Town Board effective immediately and shall be reviewed annually at its
Organizational Meeting.

COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Can you explain why on the first and last day of the travel, Barb has put in seventy-five
10

TB July 16, 2014
percent (75%)? What’s her reasoning there?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
New York State statute or federal statute, I’m not sure which. If you’re leaving from
home, I believe most people would probably try to eat breakfast at home, and so you
only get seventy-five percent (75%) of your meals for that day and the same when
you’re coming home. Hopefully when you get home, you’ll probably have dinner at
home with your family.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
That’s the one I’ve been having questions about though, so we’ll take that back to
discussion.
SUPERVISOR MOORE

WHEREAS, the Henrietta Town Board, by Resolution dated May 4, 1955,
established a Recreation Commission pursuant to New York General Municipal Law §
11

TB July 16, 2014
243 to oversee and conduct recreation activities and facilities owned or controlled by
the Town, and
WHEREAS, the Town’s Recreation Department has grown and developed over
the almost 60 years since the creation of the Recreation Commission and has
established numerous recreation programs and facilities for Town recreation activities,
and
WHEREAS, in response to the growth of the recreation program and the
establishment of Federal, State, and County oversight of various aspects of these
programs, the Town Board has assumed many of the duties of the Recreation

members and the length of term of appointment of said members by further Resolution

Yes, under discussion, previous to the meeting, a resident asked me about the term
issue. Those who are on the Recreation Commission now will be transferred over into
the Recreation Committee and we look to stagger those terms and that will be done at
a meeting further down the road.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
The only other thing I want to add is as this Resolution states, this has been on the
books since 1955 and the purpose for this group has changed so much that this is
welcome…

COUNCILMAN PAGE
Thank you, Jack.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
And I just want to say I think it’s a good direction. I am not a smoker, I’m not fond of
smoking, but I have a lot of questions about the enforcement of this, so I’ll be voting
no on this.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Will current smokers be grandfathered in?

14

TB July 16, 2014
COUNCILMAN PAGE
No.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I don’t believe so. I’d also like to thank our Attorney, Mr. Mastrella, and our Deputy
Supervisor, Mr. Minotti, for the work that they did on this Resolution. Would you
please…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Has the union agreed to this?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I don’t believe so. I’m not sure they would if we asked them, so I don’t, if they want
healthy members, they’ll probably abide by this.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
But currently in New York State, any facility that’s paid for with tax dollars, including
schools, hospitals, county office buildings, are already under that regulation and this
only merely extends this to the outdoor areas…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Outdoors.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
…and other properties, including the parks. It’s no major, I mean it’s the right thing to
do.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Have any other towns done it to your knowledge?
COUNCILMAN PAGE
I have no idea.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
No idea. I know MCC will be doing it.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
They’re actually, state wide, there’s, a number of localities have passed various laws or
regulations, and they vary from municipality to municipality, but over a hundred (100)
of them. In Monroe County, I think the only one I’m aware of is, maybe Honeoye Falls.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
The village of Honeoye Falls?

15

TB July 16, 2014
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
Yeah, it might be, I can tell you…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
You don’t have to check it, Dan. You’re probably right.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
I do have it here someplace.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Does the school district have it, Rick?
COUNCILMAN PAGE
It’s law. Yes, they do. Yeah, originally when it first came out years ago, school districts
and municipalities spent thousands of dollars ($1,000s) trying to make smoke free
rooms where it had ventilation and stuff for employees, but those have been negotiated
out of union contracts and everything’s pretty much smoke free. The only change here
is the outdoor area.

cost effective, to build a new one. So please call the roll.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
That concludes our business part of the Meeting. I do have two (2) people that signed
up for public comment. The first one is Cassie Gratton. If you could please come to
the podium and your name and address and…
CASSIE GRATTON, 8 STARFLOWER DRIVE
Hello, I’m Cassie Gratton, I live at 8 Starflower Drive. I just wanted to come tonight to
introduce myself, because I’m also the Director of the Smoking and Health Action
Coalition and so we’ve been in talks regarding the playgrounds first, but now extending
the smoke free area to the campus and providing that assistance with the signage and
any educational materials that you would like distributed to the residents. Thank you.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Thank you.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Thank you, nice to meet you.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Thank you very much.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We appreciate all your help, too. The next one is Mike Stafford.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive. Had a, I had one (1) question originally and then I,
since, I got a couple more now. One, on my Agenda I didn’t have the new hires. We
didn’t have the, and I printed this off today so maybe it was changed this afternoon
19

TB July 16, 2014
from work. It didn’t have the new tax...
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Right, that was changed.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
…person, hired person. Okay. Just, when I saw that I didn’t, when I heard it I was, so
that’s one that was added? Okay. And then one eighty-one (181) was added too then?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
The last Resolution.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And that was only because we had not made a final decision in time when that was
sent out.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay, I didn’t know (inaudible). And then, the other question I have is I’ve asked a
couple times about getting the Board Meetings televised. I want to know, I would like
to know if any, if you’ve talked about that at all. I know it’s…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It was actually brought up tonight…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Oh, okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…by our Counselor. And we talked a little bit about, Brighton’s televising theirs…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…and none of us wanted, or felt like we wanted to be TV stars.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Oh. Well, it’s just nice, it’s nice for the people who can’t come to the meetings, for
work or whatever reason, that they get to know what’s going on. I mean I can tell you
20

TB July 16, 2014
I’m flipping through the channels and I probably know more about Brighton than I need
to know, but… (laughter)
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Actually we just started the discussion and we were talking about televising and then
we were talking about the use of iPads and different ways that we might be able to
have people tune in to different meetings, so the discussion just began.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay. Okay, and my last thing is when the smoking issue was brought up and the
union issue was brought up, as somebody who deals in labor all the time and I heard
that they wouldn’t agree to it anyways. Well, you’ll probably get less fight with the
smoking issue from the employees if you went to the leadership and said, “Hey, we
want to work something, we want to figure something out here.” And then just all of a
sudden…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, I would think the leadership of the union would like their union members to be
healthy.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s been proven…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
You are…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…that by not smoking you are healthier.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
You are probably correct, but it’s also, instead of just implementing something, going to
them first and saying, “Hey, this is what we want to do and this is why we want to do
it.” And it sometimes works out better that way, as a guy who’s sitting on the other
side who knows, who deals with employers all the time, that you’re a lot better off
going to them first and saying, “This is what we want to try to do,” and, than shove
something down their throat.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Point well taken.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you.

COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Is smoking currently prohibited in the trucks?
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Yes.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s already…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
It’s already been negotiated.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right. So, well the question was asked and that’s…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Good point.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
…I don’t know the current rules, I just heard the question asked and then I heard the
response and it was just…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
That’s a fair point.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yeah.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
That’s my… so, thank you.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Thank you, Mike.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Thanks, have a good week.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Thank you, Mike.
