SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is there anybody in the audience tonight that would like to speak on any agenda item?
(From audience, Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive, “Does that include the Campus Crest?”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes, that’s an agenda item, so yes. You’re more than welcome.
(Unintelligible from audience, Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Mike Stafford, 32 Essex. Last month when we were here and Campus Crest put on
their presentation, I thought there was a lot of unanswered questions that I should,
that I think should be answered before, before they get approved for the zoning
change, which includes, can they guarantee that it remains student housing? We don’t
know what kind of project it’s going to be. This project could turn into a totally
different, five (5) years down the road. Next would be, they, I’d like to know what
they’re going to do with all the extra land eventually. They say they have no plans. I
find that hard to believe that they’re, that they don’t plan on selling it off or doing
something with it sooner or later.

TB October 1, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, to correct you there, they have stated that it will be Industrial Land and I do
believe that it will be sold, from what my understanding is.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Well you didn’t say, he didn’t say he planned on selling it, so.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I didn’t think he said he was planning on holding it either.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
He didn’t, well right he didn’t say that…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It costs money…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
…exactly that’s the whole problem. That’s what I’m saying with this whole thing.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
You didn’t get many firm answers out of him.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It costs money to hold Industrial…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX WAY
Right, I realize, but he didn’t say, “Yes, I plan on selling it.” Once again I think he
used, when it came to the tax, how much taxes, I believe the words he used, but the
Minutes from the past Meeting weren’t up on the internet yet, I believe he used the
words again, “fair share”, and I really wonder what “fair share” means. I think big, I
2

TB October 1, 2014
think what big business believes is their fair share and what everybody else is…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, my understanding again is they’re going to pay the same amount that you and I
pay every day.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right. Well, fair share, I….
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well I’ll go on the Record…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
…he said that, he said that twice...
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…of saying that, okay?
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
…you know, once back in, once back in 2013 and last month. The, other thing is, was
brought up is, you know I’m still wondering, I would think that, I would think as a
Board you’d want to make sure that you keep people locally employed and to ask him,
again, to keep the work local. The building, you know it’s a 25 million dollar
($25,000,000.00) project, there’s plenty of people in this community that need work in
the construction trade. And, finally I mentioned to you Supervisor, prior to the
meeting, and you explained it to me about their stock price that the company itself, its
stock prices have fallen into, have gone down quite substantially, but you did, you
explained why and told me why that was, but that’s about it.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Mike, from the last presentation, if I heard it right, when the question came up about,
“Would it be, remain student housing, or could it change?”, I thought he did a pretty
good job of answering that, it’s marketed towards college kids, but it’s against the law
to not be able to rent it to anyone who comes in to seek it.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right.

TB October 1, 2014
COUNCILMAN PAGE
And he did give some percentages in the other ones that weren’t students. He gave
you the small percentages, so he readily admitted that it could be other than student
housing.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Right. So if I…
COUNCILMAN PAGE
So anybody who wants to rent and live with five hundred and eighty (580) other college
kids needs special attention anyway, but…
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Yes, but five (5), (laughter) but five (5) years down the road you don’t know they may
want to turn it into any kind of other housing.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Correct. And the only thing we had in our research was that the ninety (90) places that
they already own, none of them were ever sold and none of them were ever changed
from what it was originally attended.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Okay.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
That’s what we…
MIKE STAFFROD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Yes, in their last ten (10) years of business.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Correct.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
We have two (2) Public Hearings tonight. The first one is on a Proposed Local Law No.
3 of 2014. It’s a Local Law to establish a rental registry and at this point and time this
meeting is about gathering information and facts for a document that we hope to put
forth later in the year that will enable us to have some oversight over single-family
rental properties in neighborhoods. I’ve been on the Board since 2009 and I believe
that the largest problem that I think our residents have occurred since then, has been
5

TB October 1, 2014
the rental of single-family homes. So, that’s the reason that we have a document that
we’ve worked on or and overhauled to a certain extent from the Town of Greece that
we’re using as a, more or less a model. We know we have to shape it so it can move
forward and be more attuned to our community. But, I’ll open up the…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Just to interject, did you mention to the residents about the Court case?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
No, I didn’t. Earlier this week we were informed that the litigation that we were in with
Mr. Spaan, that the Town of Henrietta did prevail and that the no more than three (3)
unrelated people can reside in one (1) single-family home. So, the rental registry will,
should become a document on which it will enable our Code Enforcement people to be
able to verify some of that and verify the safety of whoever’s in the house along with
the code complaints. We’ll open up the meeting to whoever would like to come address
on this subject.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
So basically you’re looking for ideas of what you would want to see incorporated into
this policy from the public?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes.
MEREDITH SMITH, ASSOCIATE VP FOR GOVERNMENT & COMMUNITY RELATIONS, RIT
Good evening. I’m Meredith Smith, Associate VP for Government and Community
Relations at RIT, and I’m here basically to express that RIT is supportive of the
exploration of a rental registry. We’ve done some research in my office in Government
and Community Relations about rental registries that are on the books in some various
locations including in Buffalo and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and there are definitely
some intricacies involved, which I’m sure you all know as you’re exploring one here. I
think there are lessons to be learned from some of those communities and there are
some great public reports available that explain what’s been successful and not. So, I
would express, wanted to express on behalf of RIT that we would appreciate a
collaborative process with the Town. We’d love to get together to look at the language
that you are exploring and to share some of the information that we’ve gathered. We
think that the penalty that is bestowed upon a landlord is critical to having the rental
registry be effective. And in closing, I would add that we think a rental registry will
make our community safer and we think it will make our students safer and will provide
for better housing for really everyone in the Town, so thank you.

TB October 1, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Thank you.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Can I just ask a question…
MEREDITH SMITH, ASSOCIATE VP FOR GOVERNMENT & COMMUNITY RELATIONS, RIT
Sure.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…of a person making a comment?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes.
COULCILWOMAN ZINCK
Okay. You say that you think the penalty’s important. Do you have something in mind
when you say that?
MEREDITH SMITH, ASSOCIATE VP FOR GOVERNMENT & COMMUNITY RELATIONS, RIT
Sure. So, the penalties vary across the country and in some cases a penalty for failing
to register is as small as a twenty dollar ($20.00) fine. I don’t think that that’s
significant enough to help us cope with some of our absentee landlords. I, other cases
penalties can add up to you not having your C. of O. (Certificate of Occupancy)
renewed, which is pretty significant, which obviously makes it impossible for someone
to occupy the property. So, I think within the bounds, you know of the, of the Law
obviously, and what courts would uphold in New York State, we would, we need to be
as severe as possible.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Thank you.
MEREDITH SMITH, ASSOCIATE VP FOR GOVERNMENT & COMMUNITY RELATIONS, RIT
Anybody else? Okay.
COUCILMAN MULLIGAN
Quick, Meredith…

TB October 1, 2014
MEREDITH SMITH, ASSOCIATE VP FOR GOVERNMENT & COMMUNITY RELATIONS, RIT
Yes?
COUCILMAN MULLIGAN
…would you be willing to play a role in a committee, Councilman Page talked about
having RIT and residents involved in this process and you representing the school, I
think it would be beneficial for you to play an important part of that.
MEREDITH SMITH, ASSOCIATE VP FOR GOVERNMENT & COMMUNITY RELATIONS, RIT
Absolutely. We’d be appreciative of the opportunity to do so.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes, I mean, before we came out here tonight, Rick had mentioned the fact that he
thought that going forward for the Community, we would have to put together a
Community of shareholders that have been basically a lot of people in the audience
have had their lives disrupted because of rental property and, you know, you live in it
every day with the student population, so I think it’s very important we bring everybody
together and figure out we can put forth a document and a Local Law that we all can
be proud of.
MEREDITH SMITH, ASSOCIATE VP FOR GOVERNMENT & COMMUNITY RELATIONS, RIT
That would be great. It would be my pleasure.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Councilor Mastrella did an exceptional job of reviewing the Proposed Code that we used
as a boiler plate, and we have significant work to get that ready. Once we do that, and
present it and get it ready, we’re going to invite people from the community, the stake
holders in for their professional opinion, what needs to changed, what needs to be
added, what needs to be deleted. I promise you we’ll do that.
MEREDITH SMITH, ASSOCIATE VP FOR GOVERNMENT & COMMUNITY RELATIONS, RIT
Great.

Okay.

Thanks Meredith.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is there anybody else that would like to speak on… Carol, please.
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
Carol Burritt, 620 Shore Drive. I just have a question. In doing some research and I
actually went back a few years when I was doing some research on this whole subject,
you say that we’re basing it on a Greece…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Correct. There’s a document that the Town of Greece adopted this past year.
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We also have documents from Brockport and Irondequoit…
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
Irondequoit, okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…and I believe the Village of Geneseo and…
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
I did notice that Syracuse has had a lawsuit brought against it when they tried to say
do a super-enforcement of landlords that were renting very close to Syracuse
University. It seems that a lot of these towns that come up, Buffalo, Syracuse, a lot of
this probably came up because of the proximity to large institutes, college institutions
and universities and such. But I did notice that Syracuse had a lawsuit, a couple of
lawsuits being brought against it, especially by the landlords near the colleges. And I
was wondering if you had looked into that as to what results have happened so far,
because we don’t need to put something into effect that is going, that we’re going to
have to drag through court for another three (3) or four (4) years. You know, I’d like
to see something that’s been well tested.
9

TB October 1, 2014
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
May I speak to the question? Yes, the answer is yes, I have looked at some court
decisions regarding rental registries or their equivalent. And it, it’s evolving. I don’t
expect that anybody can do a perfect job with this, and the challenges are relatively
new, they’re relatively young and there isn’t something that’s so well established that
we can rely on it. What I will say is that the reason this is introduced at this time is to
get the ball rolling. There’s a, the document that’s proposed is based on the Town of
Greece. I have already suggested several modifications, revisions, etc. to it. I don’t
think what you’re ultimately going to see is, is at all going to be what is proposed now.
And, it given time constraints and when things have to be voted on, I think the Board is
fully prepared to continue to listen to not pass this until it’s in a form where it is, at
least we believe to be workable and in fact, if they have to due to time deadlines, just
vote no on this Rental Registry Law in the hopes of getting a better one. So, I don’t
want you to, I don’t want anybody to have the impression that because this is
introduced as a Local Law, that it’s immanent. By the same token, doing it this way
gets everybody, it’s a little kick in the behind to get everybody moving ahead at a
greater pace than might otherwise be. So, this is definitely a work in progress and
what’s proposed, what’s on the table right now, is no more than a platform.
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
Okay. I guess my other comments would be, I would hope that in considering the
kinds of registration fees that would be charged against landlords, would be seriously
put aside. Levied and put aside to have enough personnel and resources to put some
teeth into the enforcement.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Can I answer a little bit?
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
Yes.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
In the proposed or preliminary budget tonight there is an additional Code Enforcement,
full-time officer that will be hired to be dedicated to what we’re going to put forth. And
hopefully by the first of the year we’ll be able to implement what this dialogue here and
the ongoing process is so that we will have a rental registry by the first of the year.
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
Okay.
10

TB October 1, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
With personnel to back it up. And I, like Meredith said, if we don’t have some teeth in
the part of the law that hurts the person in the pocketbook, they’re going to continue to
make those mistakes.
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
Oh yeah.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I’m not one to probably give you more than one (1) chance or two (2).
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
And I guess the last thing I want to say, is I would never want to see any volume
discounts on the fees, please.
(Laughter)
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
In fact I’d like to see them go up. The more you own, the bigger the fee.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Carol, would you be willing to sit on the Committee?
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
Definitely.
(Laughter)
COUNCILMAN PAGE
I know where you live. I’ll be in touch.
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE

You’re hired, okay?
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK

TB October 1, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is there anybody else that would like to speak on this? (Pause, no response) Seeing
none, I’d like to go ahead and close this Public Hearing, and we’ll go to the next Public
Hearing. It’s for our Town Budget. It’s fiscal year 2015. It’s our Preliminary Budget for
the Town of Henrietta. Our Finance Director Barbara Chirdo is going to walk us through
what her and her staff have worked on most of the summer. They’ve done an excellent
job. I’m very proud of this Budget. She actually even gave me some notes that I was
supposed to read when I was up here that I didn’t bring with me, but I will tell you that
it appears to be at this point in time that the tax rate is proposed to go down by six
point two five percent (6.25 %). We’ll be holding the line on spending as spending will
be up by about three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00), but we will actually
collect about two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) less in total taxes, because
of the way they treated Marketplace Mall with the PILOT agreement.
PILOT
agreements aren’t really considered in part of your tax levy, but Barbara will explain
that. I’m very proud of the Budget we put forth and the way the Town Board had
reviewed it and helped get us to this point, but I’ll turn it over to Barbara.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
And Mr. Supervisor, before she starts on the Public Hearing for the rental registry, I
assume you’re just closing it for this evening’s presentation but it, that it remains open
for consideration of the new materials that will be coming.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Oh, correct. I mean it’s just going to be an ongoing process, I just…
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
Okay. So it’s an open…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I usually close Public Hearings so, this one is an ongoing document moving forward.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
It’s an open item…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Correct.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
…it’s just we’re done with it tonight.

TB October 1, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you, Councilor.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes.
BARBARA CHIRDO, DIRECTOR OF FINANCE
Now it’s me. Thank you Supervisor Moore and Members of the Town Board. I’m here
tonight, as the Supervisor expressed, to present an overview of the 2015 Preliminary
Budget. The proposed appropriations in the 2015 Budget allow the Town to deliver the
highest level of service, emphasizes our continued commitment to the future of the
community, and recognizes the importance of affordability to our residential and
business tax payers. As the Supervisor also mentioned, the general Town tax rate for
2015 is proposed to be at one dollar and approximately sixteen cents ($1.16) per one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00) of assessed value. This proposed tax rate is actually
equal to what the rate was in 2005. So the average Henrietta tax payer with an
assessed value of one hundred and forty four thousand dollars ($144,000.00) will pay
one hundred and sixty six dollars and fifty nine cents ($166.59) for Town General
services. In comparison to 2014, this is nearly ten dollars ($10.00) less with no
reduction in services. As we were formulating the Budget, obviously as we all know by
now that the Tax Payer Assistance Program was put into effect, once the Governor
signed the legislation and the Town was able to pass that Local Law. To date, we have
issued almost ten thousand (10,000) checks totaling nearly one million dollars
($1,000,000.00), and as I said that was taken into account as we put together the
Budget, and, because as we know the surplus issue, we wanted to look at affordability
and giving back to the tax payers. As far as our non-tax revenue estimates for 2015, as
you can see, we’re nearly twelve million dollars ($12,000,000.00) in nontax revenue.
This results from a strong economy in Monroe County, that as consumer spending has
led to a projection of nearly four and a half percent (4.5%) increase in our sales tax
projection, and as the Supervisor mentioned, there was also a COMIDA agreement with
Marketplace Mall. That led to a significant increase in what the Town will be receiving
in PILOT revenue, nearly sixty percent (60%) more than we received in 2014. Although
that impacts the taxable assessed value, of all properties we do essentially get the
money in another form through the revenue through a PILOT. A little bit more on the
non-tax revenue sources, as I mentioned sales tax, and I mentioned the PILOT, and it’s
kind of smushed down there at the bottom, but, also within that you’ll see services to
other governments. That is, the Town, as we probably know, provides services for the
13

TB October 1, 2014
State and County to maintain the roadways located within Henrietta, provides snow and
ice removal services as well as do routine maintenance throughout the year. This is a
depiction of our taxable value. A slight drop, although Henrietta still experiences
significant growth in both commercial and residential, (coughing), excuse me, building
throughout the Town. We had the little bit of decrease because of the PILOT, but we
make up for it on the revenue side of things. People often ask, “Where does your tax
dollar actually go?” This is a breakdown of a dollar bill ($1.00) more or less. As you
can see, equipment and capital outlay is about thirteen cents ($0.13). What’s cut off
there at the bottom is contractual expenses which is thirty six cents ($0.36). So
essentially the Town spends between equipment and maintaining infrastructure and
hiring contractors to assist us in such, nearly fifty cents ($0.50) of every dollar ($1.00)
goes towards that. A large portion of the Town’s budget is allocated to the Highway
Service Garage and transportation. Departments for, they obviously maintain the
roads, as well as our equipment. Recreation and cultural appropriations in parks,
library and recreation total nearly a quarter (1/4) of the budget. It’s the pies at the
bottom there; eight percent (8%) each. As I mentioned, here’s a depiction for the
Highway Service Garage and transportation, over three point eight million dollars
($3,800,000.00) of the Budget is appropriated for these departments, and that’s twenty
one percent (21%) of the budget. Those departments maintain over nearly two
hundred and sixty five (265) miles of Town lane miles as well as taking care of the
State and County miles, which is nearly a hundred and ninety one (191) miles. Our
library is part of our culture and recreations that I mentioned being almost a quarter
(1/4) of the budget. Library in particular is about eight percent (8%), a little over one
point four million dollars ($1,400,000.00) is appropriated for 2015. What’s impressive is
our library is quite popular. In 2013 circulation exceeded four hundred and seventy
four thousand (474,000) pieces, which is approximately thirteen hundred (1,300) items
per day, which is pretty astounding and is a very valuable resource to the Town. Our
Recreation, Senior Center, and celebrations budgets, that’s a nice picture of our Senior
Center, those appropriations are a little over one point four million (1,400,000.00),
which is again about eight percent (8%) of the budget. In 2013, the Recreation and
Senior Center offered over six hundred and ten (610) programs for all ages of residents
in our community. One difference in our budget this year is the appropriation to the
Henrietta Ambulance, which is collected as part of the tax levy of the Town, is included
in the Town Budget. In years past, this was not included as part of our Budget.
However, based on the State Comptroller’s report issued late last year, it was
erroneously left off and does need to be included in our Budget. So, therefore the
appropriation of a little over seven hundred thousand dollars ($700,000.00) is collected
on behalf of the Ambulance. That entire amount is distributed to the Ambulance to
offset and defray costs to the Henrietta residents for emergency services provided by
the Ambulance. Another significant portion of the Budget is our capitol and equipment
14

TB October 1, 2014
appropriation.
For 2015, that is just under two point four million dollars
($2,400,000.00). Again, you can see that the strong emphasis is on our infrastructure
and roads, infrastructure being about forty percent (40%) and roads being about thirty
percent (30%), so, you know, approximately seventy percent (70%) is spent to really
maintain the infrastructure of Henrietta. In conclusion, the Town’s Preliminary Budget
totals eighteen million, three hundred and twenty eight thousand and sixteen dollars
($18,328,016.00), an increase of slightly over two point two percent (2.2%) over 2014.
As the Supervisor mentioned, even with an increase of appropriations, the actual Town
tax collection will be two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) less than what was
collected in 2014 or nearly four percent (4%) less. And that’s our pretty slide to end
with.
(Laughter)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you, Barbara. As you can see, it’s a little bit different budget and a little bit
different budget presentation than we’ve been accustomed to. We went to a little bit
more of a realistic budget, our revenues are what we think the projections will be and
our expenditures are what we think we will be, different than in the past when we
underestimated revenue and overestimated expenses. So, at this point in time I would
invite anybody that would like to come and speak on this issue to come forward. I
have to have your name and address Rita.
