islands.
3. Green space is 17.5%, up from 16%.
4. Due to the proposed improvements, the expected storm water flow will
decrease by 5% to the existing pond at the northwest corner of the

parcels’ green space will have to have their own calculations during
separate site plan applications.

are significant improvements being made to the green space and storm
water treatment of the existing site.
2. Future outparcels shall be reviewed by the Henrietta Conservation Board,
and shall meet the 25% minimum green space requirements.
