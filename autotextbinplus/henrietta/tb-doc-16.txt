MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive. Just would like to get a, hope we get a good explanation
on the tax settlement with Sam’s Club.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I’d have to call on our Assessor for that.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
I’d like to, I’d just like to know why they’re getting nineteen thousand dollars

We can’t give away tax money without

NATE GABBERT, TOWN ASSESSOR
There’s a short answer and a long answer.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, the short one please.
NATE GABBERT, TOWN ASSESSOR
The short one is that Sam’s Club sued us for a reduction in their assessment and this is
a settlement which will recognize a modest reduction for last year with an increase over
next year to recognize improvements they’re making out there. That’s the short
answer.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
What’s it cost the Town?
NATE GABBERT, TOWN ASSESSOR
In this particular case, it would be a few hundred dollars ($100), but this particular
agreement waives any refunds on the Town part. Because they were only a modest
amount, the attorney for the petitioner suggested it and so we decided that it was
okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But we bore the cost for all our legal fees.
NATE GABBERT, TOWN ASSESSOR
Yes we did.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay. Thank you very much.
NATE GABBERT, TOWN ASSESSOR
Sure.

And Mike, if you want the long version, he’d be happy to share it with you afterwards.

No, this particular one is just for one year.

CHRIS MARTIN, DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING & PLANNING
For the Record, my name is Chris Martin. I am the Director of Engineering & Planning
for the Town of Henrietta. And the Application tonight is for an extension of a lighting
district for the Queens Park Subdivision. We have preliminary approval for this
subdivision, but they haven’t gone for final subdivision approval yet. But we wanted to
form the lighting district. It’s going to be very similar to Berkshire Park Subdivision,
which is to the west.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay.
CHRIS MARTIN, DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING & PLANNING
That’s it. Thank you.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
Oh, I’m sorry, it’s on the Agenda. Then we’ll go ahead and close this Public Hearing.
I’m sorry about that. The next Public Hearing is 48 Rouge Road Property Cleanup. Is
the owner of the property here?

(From audience, Daniel McMinn, “The owner, no. I’m his son.”)

5

TB August 20, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
How do we proceed, Counselor?
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
You should have Terry come up to present what’s going on.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Mr. Ekwell, would you come up and cite the issue?
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
The property has been, at 48 Rouge Road, has been under observation for a number
of, length of time, for violations of both the Town Property Maintenance Code and the
New York State Property Maintenance Code. Violations have been sent out to the
owner of the property with no response. I did send a letter August 4th, it was sent by
Certified mail. It was sent out of the Post Office on the 4th, excuse me on the 5th it left
at 4:30 in the morning and it was delivered at the address at 12:35 p.m. on April 5th.
The letter, you have a copy of, states the number of violations out there, the things
that have to be taken care of. You have pictures from July 21st, which is prior to the
letter being written. You have pictures from today, this afternoon, showing the state of
the property. The state of the property this afternoon is not in compliance of what the
letter stated. Therefore, the next action is up to the Board. The owner of the property
is Mr. and Mrs. Paul McMinn.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And they’re not here.
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
They are not here, no.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Counselor, how do we proceed?
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
Well, they don’t have to be here. The, just, if you don’t mind, I’ll ask Terry a few
questions. Have these individuals been cited under the Town Code into court for
violations in the past?
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
I believe so. Yes, Code Enforcement Officer, in fact the Judge did put an action out
against them. They failed to appear in court.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
And so some, if not all, of these violations, they’ve been previously cited for and the
action in court has not led to them being corrected. Is that…
6

TB August 20, 2014
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
That is correct.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
…fair to say?
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
That is correct.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
And is it also fair to say that these are persistent violations? In other words, they’ve
been going on for a series of months, if not years?
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
That is correct.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
And really, is there any other avenue that you have in order to get this property back
into compliance, other than what you’ve taken thus far and ultimately taken it to the
Town Board for an order?
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
No, there doesn’t appear to be any voluntary compliance and the court order has been
disregarded, so therefore the only action we have left is action by the Town to make
the property compliant with both the Property Maintenance Code of the Town of
Henrietta and the New York State Property Maintenance Code.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
And the pictures that you submitted to, with this Public Hearing notice, do they fairly
clearly show that the property remains out of compliance as of this date?
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
Correct. The only difference between today’s pictures and those on the twenty-first
(21st) of July was the junked abandoned car had been removed and part of the front
lawn had been mowed.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
And the remedy that is sought here is for the Town to either its own personnel or hire
personnel to go in and to perform whatever needs to be done in order to bring this into
compliance and then the cost of doing that will be paid out of Town general funds, but
will be levied upon the property in the same manner as other Town charges and taxes.
Is that correct?
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
That is correct.

TB August 20, 2014
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
With that, I think you can open it up to the public. If the owner’s son wants to speak, I
think he should be welcomed to.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is there anybody in the audience that would like to speak on this issue? Please come to
the microphone and state your name and address and why you have your hardship.
DANIEL McMINN, 48 ROUGE ROAD
I’m Paul McMinn’s son, Daniel McMinn. I live at the residence. Paul currently doesn’t
live there, but I have been, it’s not, we have not been ignoring compliance with the
court, etc. It’s, my father’s ill, my parents are in the middle of a divorce, I’m supposed
to be assuming ownership of the house and the legal papers haven’t been signed over
the past few months. Yes, there is previous, before this ongoing in the past few
months. The divorce has only been going on for about a year, but I personally haven’t,
amongst my own legal issues, haven’t really had the time, but I have freed up that time
in the last week and a half, which I’ve actually been making an attempt. I got the car
gone, cleaned up the front yard, the backyard. All day today, I’m getting the things off
from the side next to the garage trying to clean all that up. The multiple mess of things
in the driveway are all gone. I am making an attempt. I mean, I can’t work overnight.
I mean, I have less people than what’s sitting behind the counter, but…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Honestly, you need a bulldozer.
DANIEL McMINN, 48 ROUGE ROAD
Yeah, no kidding.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You got a truck engine out of a tractor trailer sitting beside the garage; you got at least
four (4) truck rear ends sitting there; you got a bus that’s a monument; you got fuel oil
barrels in the front yard; rubbish in the backyard. If I were your neighbor, I’d have
been pretty upset with you a long time ago. And we’ve given you a lot of chances, so,
any questions from the Board?
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yeah, no, it’s not that we’re unsympathetic to…
DANIEL McMINN, 48 ROUGE ROAD
Oh no, no, no, no, no. I’m just saying that.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…everything that’s going on, but I mean I looked at those pictures today and I have to
tell you I would be out of my mind if I had to look at that every day.

TB August 20, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
So what we’re going to have to do is we’re going to go in and clean it up and we’re
going to fix the house so it’s presentable on the outside, because your neighbors have
put up with a terrible mess for a long time and your dad didn’t seem to want to
conform to where he was living in a neighborhood. So now we’re going to fix it. Thank
you.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Thank you.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
And you should just, you should be aware that anything that you can do to make it, to
make the property better before anybody from the Town goes in to do it will obviously
ultimately save the owner some money, because it’s work that you don’t have to pay
the Town to do ultimately.
DANIEL McMINN, 48 ROUGE ROAD
That makes sense.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Right, because it will be put on the taxes.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Get a thirty (30) yard dumpster.
DANIEL McMINN, 48 ROUGE ROAD
Oh, I know that.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Yeah, get a thirty (30) yard dumpster and fill it.
DANIEL McMINN, 48 ROUGE ROAD
Most of that’s all gone. I took out probably four (4) truck loads last week. So…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Well again, just so you know that wasn’t in vain, that that’ll be less that will be billed to
the property.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And don’t ever let it get this way again, because we’ll be back.
DANIEL McMINN, 48 ROUGE ROAD
Oh, I’m well aware of that.

That concludes the Resolution part of the Meeting and now I have some people that
signed up for public comment. And the first one is Janice Pryll.
JANICE PRYLL, 60 CHILTERN ROAD
Hello, I’m Janice Pryll. I live at 60 Chiltern Road and I’m not sure, I’m here to speak on
the backyard habitat.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You can speak on anything you want now.

TB August 20, 2014
JANICE PRYLL, 60 CHILTERN ROAD
So this is the time?
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
This is it.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes, this is it.
JANICE PRYLL, 60 CHILTERN ROAD
Okay, I’m in favor of the proposed revision of the backyard habitat code and I have
visited Brighton backyard habitats in the past and I wondered what their code was. So
I called them up and their Department of Building and Planning said that they only have
a code for the height of the grass mowing and for any obstruction of a clear view that’s
needed for safety regulations. So I throw that out just as a comparison. And this
backyard habitat is for butterflies and birds and not for woodchucks and raccoons like
some people might worry that might wander into the backyard. So I just wanted to
make that point and I think you need to consider the definition of the word natural. So
I think anything that is in the backyard should be natural to the habitat that is in this
area according to our weather and so forth. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You’re welcome. Thank you.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
To clarify a little bit about the backyard butterfly and birds habitat, we are in the
process of looking at adopting a Code that is going to enable people to have that in
their backyards. We’ll probably be the first town in Monroe County to do it. John, and
I can’t pronounce your last name, has been very instrumental in that happening. He’s
here in the audience tonight and he’s the one that’s brought that to our attention. We
will be having a Public Hearing in early to late fall discussing all the different code
revisions that are going to be made and there’ll be public comment at that point in time
too. And as soon as we have some more information, we’re waiting now for an
attorney to look over the project so that we can make sure we have our SEQRA done
on it. And then we’ll be able to move forward with, I believe there’s a hundred and
forty-seven (147) different codes. Am I right, Peter?

(From audience, Peter Minotti, Deputy Supervisor, “Mr. Supervisor, there are a hundred
sixty-four (164) proposed changes.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay. They’ve been working on it for six (6) years. So hopefully I’ll have it done by
20

TB August 20, 2014
the tenth (10 ) month of our administration. But it’s an important part of the revision,
so everybody knows. And this Board has been very cooperative and very, I think,
forthright or forthcoming in looking at how we can adapt that into everybody’s lives.
But right now I know John sent an email out today that he had to, his yard I call an
experiment, but he’s not within the Code, so he had to actually do some weeding in his
yard to get the grass under six inches (6”) and he did it for us, so thank you. But the
next person is Jean Summers.
th

JUNE SUMMERS, 208 RHEA CRESCENT, GREECE, NEW YORK
I’m June Summers.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Oh, I’m sorry.
JUNE SUMMERS, 208 RHEA CRESCENT, GREECE, NEW YORK
It’s like the sixth (6th) month of the year and the season with an ‘s’ on the end of it.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yeah, it’s called strawberry time.

(Laughter)
JUNE SUMMERS, 208 RHEA CRESCENT, GREECE, NEW YORK
And I am president of Genesee Valley Audubon Society. And we support the adoption
of the proposed Code amendment entitled residential backyard habitat. In the words of
Doug Tollamy, “Unfortunately local extinction is rampant in human dominated
landscapes.” The monoculture that we call lawns and the trees we plant such as
Norway maples and the tree of heaven support few, if any, native insects, which means
there is very little food for native birds. By adding diversity of plants to their
landscapes, the residents of Henrietta can be part of a national trend of adding diversity
to help birds and other wildlife. The National Audubon Society’s backyard habitat
program is called Audubon At Home. The National Wildlife Federation has had a
backyard habitat certification program for as long as I can remember and the Cornell
Ornithology lab has a program called Yard Map. Yard Map asks participants to map out
their native plants in their backyard habitat on their website and get their neighbors
involved as well. Genesee Valley Audubon Society hopes that the Henrietta Town
Board will adopt this amendment but promote it, not only adopt it but promote it, and
ask their residents to use native plants in their backyard habitats. We applaud you for
even considering this and being the first town in Monroe County to do so. Thank you
very much.

The next person and the last one is Bonnie Deal.
BONNIE DEAL, 40 WESTMINSTER PARK
Hi.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You have to state your name and…
BONNIE DEAL, 40 WESTMINSTER PARK
My name is Bonnie Deal. I live at 40 Westminster Park. I think that’s awesome, I get
great birds at my feeder, I feed all year. But I’m talking about Campus Crest. We
didn’t want it last time, we don’t want it this time. I already get screwed by Ben
Coglitore for paying him to drive across his land. I don’t get the same service as
everybody else in Henrietta. Don’t put transient housing up, because if that’s the case,
I’m leaving. Don’t chase out the families that live there. Please, we didn’t want
Campus Crest before, we don’t want it now.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We’re in the process, we called for a Public Hearing for a rezone…
BONNIE DEAL, 40 WESTMINSTER PARK
Well…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…and you’ll have your opportunity to speak, just like everybody did last time, but you
can’t deny a family the right to sell their farm for something.
BONNIE DEAL, 40 WESTMINSTER PARK
I don’t deny a family the right to sell their farm. I don’t want transient housing.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I think that when you see the plan that Campus Crest has, where there’s no traffic
coming out to East River Road, that it will maybe be acceptable, but it’s a plan that they
want to present and you can’t stop people from doing that.

TB August 20, 2014
BONNIE DEAL, 40 WESTMINSTER PARK
I can’t, but if it comes in, I’m going. And if I can’t sell my house, then I’ll rent it. So

JOHN COLAGROSSO, 81 LONG BRANCH DRIVE
Thanks, I’m John Colagrosso. I live at 81 Long Branch Drive. As you know, I was cited
for violation of Code §205. I think I’m in compliance now. If I could afford it, I’d hire
an attorney to make sure I was in compliance, because it is not my desire to not be.
However, since we are going to consider the Code, I thought it was going to be tonight,
but it seems like it’s going to be in the near future. What I would request of you is to
allow me to reestablish my backyard habitat and to use it as a demonstration to show
you and the other citizens of Henrietta what a backyard habitat can be. I would like
that, an exemption from the current Code until such time that you do consider the
proposed backyard habitat Code, you either adopt it or you reject it. So an extension
until that time, an exemption from the current Code until that time I would appreciate
it.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I don’t believe we can give exemptions, but we’ll let the Counselor speak.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
Technically speaking, he could make, potentially make application to the Zoning Board
if it’s a zoning issue. If it’s not a zoning issue, then nobody really…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s property maintenance.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
…nobody has the authority to give him any type of formal extension. It becomes a
question of enforcement.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, and he did comply though so we appreciate it.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Have him apply to the Zoning Board.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s not a zoning issue, it’s a property code…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
No, he’s saying it’s not a zoning issue.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…it’s a property maintenance issue.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
If it’s property maintenance, unless our property maintenance Code, and I can take a
24

TB August 20, 2014
look and talk to him about it (inaudible).”
SUPERVISOR MOORE
If you could, that would be great.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
I will.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, thank you. John Schmitt?
JOHN SCHMITT, 139 CAMPFIRE ROAD NORTH
This week Henrietta lost a great friend. The passing of Rachel Warren was something
that I would like the Town Board, if it’s possible, and I don’t know the wording, but in
some way in their Minutes or whatever, some kind of a note expressing the gratitude of
the Town of Henrietta for the love that she showed this Town, for the endless hours
she spent working. And typical of what Rachel was interested in, I’m going to ask you
people to please keep your eye on how much open space we have in the Town of
Henrietta. That’s one of her great things. We are a great Town because we have
space, green space, and it’s so important, vitally important to the future that we
maintain that. So in memory of Rachel and the great love we all had for her, carry on
in that particular mode. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Thank you.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
John, I just want to say I had no idea, and when they were talking about the backyard
habitat, she’s absolutely the first person I thought of. I thought, “Rachel would like
this.”
JOHN SCHMITT, 139 CAMPFIRE ROAD NORTH
Yeah.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
I’m sorry to hear that.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
John, if you would, you know that we both knew her very well, but you knew her much
better than I did, if you would put together some thoughts together, we’d be happy to
read them into the Record at the next Board Meeting, so it would be a permanent
memory for her. Okay?

JOHN SCHMITT, 139 CAMPFIRE ROAD NORTH
Thank you.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
You’re welcome.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yeah, we can do a proclamation or a Resolution honoring Rachel. Is there anybody
else that would like to speak that didn’t sign up? Whoever’s in the back, I can’t see.
Mr. Greco. Commander Greco I guess.
COMMANDER JACK GRECO, 104 LITTMAN ROAD
Commander Greco, 104 Littman Road. Two (2) comments. One (1) is there’s a lot of
positive energy in the room right now, both for a life that is, that was real, and life that
is plants and birds and animals, so I support that. I also support the conservation
concept that if any organization or any town, not just Henrietta, starts building
buildings, it becomes a metropolis and it’s no longer a town, so I think the Town has
done a good job in balancing those two (2) things. Lastly, I would be very interested in
the Resolution #15-190/2014, which talks about the declaration of surplus materials.
I’m always interested in surplus. I work with the Sea Cadets and sometimes extend to
the Boy Scouts, and they could use surplus, so if there’s an index or a list of surplus
that’s being, that’s available, it would be…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I’d be glad to give it to you, Jack. It’s a book truck that was bought in 1995 and some
type of book stand, atlas, 1978.
COMMANDER JACK GRECO, 104 LITTMAN ROAD
That’s it?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
That’s it.

(Laughter)
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yeah.
COMMANDER JACK GRECO, 104 LITTMAN ROAD
Maybe I could rephrase it. It seems like from time to time there is always a list, not
just this town, but other towns, of surplus items and it seems like we’re doing like a
little bit here and a little bit there and a little bit there. Is there ever this opportunity
where there’s a huge quantity of books that we’re getting rid of at one time or four (4)
or ten (10) desks at one time, whereas you’re collecting these…
26

TB August 20, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We don’t get rid of desks. We reuse them. They cost money.
COMMANDER JACK GRECO, 104 LITTMAN ROAD
I understand. Alright, well I, looking at excess material I’m always trying to help the
right hand and the right hand, left hand, but thank you very much.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Just to answer that a little bit, if it’s something that has some value that the Town can
sell or send to auction, we do that. If it’s something that’s kind of obsolete, such as the
items here tonight, then they, they’re discarded of.
COMMANDER JACK GRECO, 104 LITTMAN ROAD
Got it. Thank you very much.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
You’re welcome.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is there anybody else? Carol?
CAROL BURRITT, 620 SHORE DRIVE
Once again, Carol Burritt, 620 Shore Drive. I just have a couple of questions that came
up today. As you may or may not know, moving day was this past weekend for,
basically for RIT students and our neighborhood is filled up once again. And I’ve kind
of been, even for the last month, letting things ride saying okay, we’ll just let things
settle and then take a look at what the new crop looks like. But Carol Malach here, she
took a walk this morning and I think you all received some pictures from Oak Mills
Crossing. And questioned the Town and Code Enforcement as to why there, there’s so
many cars are allowed in a driveway and trash is out by the road spilling out of garbage
cans. The trash bins are not out of sight, which, this is common. I mean this is not
just today, but she happened to take a walk today. And her answer, the answer she
got kind of, it really worried me, because number one (1), she was told that as long as
cars are in a driveway and not in a yard, it doesn’t matter how many are there. And I
looked up the Code and that seems to be a contradiction of the Code, because it’s only
supposed to be four (4), according to what’s published in the Town Record. Another
thing that bothered me too was the contention that there’s kind of like a daily patrol in
those streets to see what’s going on. And unfortunately I can cite a house on Valley
View Drive where a trash bin sat on the curb for a month, a full month. There has
been, let me see, I can probably pull it right up here, yes, that was at 138 Valley View
Drive. That’s a rental property by the way. And at 588 Shore Drive, there is I guess
27

TB August 20, 2014
what you would call like a tar wagon, or a tar trailer, something you would use for
sealing driveways. That’s been sitting next to the garage, right up by the street for
over a week and it comes and goes. And there’s also, as I was leaving tonight, there’s
also a pickup truck parked in the road. That used to be a house where a family lived; it
was sold about a year ago and I’ve noticed it’s going down the tubes since then.
Various trucks come and go. I think right now I don’t see any people there, but I think
it’s basically being used to store either construction equipment or business equipment
or something like that. And as far as the definition of parking in the yard, I think
students have this idea that if you’re half in the yard, you’re in compliance. It’s the
usual thing that happens when they have so many cars that the one that’s hiding in the
garage can’t get out unless they’re all like half into the yard on a diagonal. In fact
there’s a house across from me that usually has about oh, five (5) to seven (7) cars
parked diagonally in the driveway and another car in the garage and there are times
where the last car is basically half in the road and half in the yard, to the point where
Mr. Spaan has to come every year and fill in all the ditches where the cars have parked
in the yards. And I don’t see where there’s been any great effort to change any of this.
I mean Mr. Spaan I’m sure doesn’t even tell these students what the rules are. And I
don’t get the feeling that RIT is informing them of our rules. And I’m just wondering
how we can get the word out and then enforce the rules that are supposedly on the
books. I, you know I know that we’re going to be going to court once again with Mr.
Spaan on September 11th for one more hearing as to how many students he can legally
put in those houses, but I’m here to tell you that whatever is legal in many, many cases
there’s a lot more. One of the houses that Carol Malach took a picture of this morning,
I went by this afternoon and they had the garage door open. There’s a reason why
they can’t park in the garage, because it’s lined with couches. It’s a flop house and I’ve
heard from the neighbors that on the weekends that’s the big party place. Next door
they had the garage door open tonight and that’s where the foosball table is, so I think
they just have a, like a running club going or whatever. So just, I’d just like some
clarification as to what the rules are so if I happen to talk to any of the students. I did
talk to one last week who had just kind of thrown out some bags of trash by the road
and let them sit there for a week. And I confronted him and said, “You know, they’re
not supposed to be there and they’ve been there for a week.” And he said, “No, they’re
not.” And I said, “Yes, they are.” And I said, “Would you put them in the garage until
it’s trash day?” And he was very nice. He said, “Fine, okay.” And he did. So you
know, instead of me having to go one by one and tell them the rules, I wish somebody
else would kind of inform them and enforce them. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I’ve asked Mr. Spaan to come in and see me and I’m not sure he’s going to, but he’s
the landlord for about, I would say thirty-five (35) homes in that neighborhood and I
still believe he’s running a business in a residential area. But we can’t seem to find the
law to get on the right side of us so that we can do something. Yes, sir.
KARTHI SUGUNAN, 33 RIVER MEADOW DRIVE
My name is Karthi Sugunan. I have a few ash trees on the property and they are in
28

TB August 20, 2014
very good shape, but I hear there’s a problem in Chili, lots of trees are dying because of
Emerald Ash Borer. So if we took a concerted effort, because it’s a common value, it
doesn’t matter where it is, it adds the beauty and wellbeing to all the residents, it may
be more cost effective. I mean, of course we’ll be paying, but if it’s a collective effort to
save them, I think it’ll be more focused, because if you have a neighbor’s tree which is
not treated, it’s going to attack. So if you have a treatment plan and, at least if you
negotiate a plan we can pay into.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, it’s funny you ask about that, I’ve had Urban Forestry give us a quote. I think it
came in last Friday on inventory of all the Town owned trees and coming up with what
we could do to save our ash trees.
KARTHI SUGUNAN, 33 RIVER MEADOW DRIVE
So if you could give that company name, we can ask them for a quote, that may be
something he can do.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well I think what they’re going to do is they’re going to come back with a
recommendation after, we haven’t even discussed it with the, I haven’t discussed it
with the Board yet, and figure out what we can do to help the trees.
KARTHI SUGUNAN, 33 RIVER MEADOW DRIVE
What’s the company name, please?

COUNCILMAN PAGE
Carol, just to speak about parking in the driveway. The current Code, the way it’s
written now, you looked it up, but in the process of rewriting our Codes over the years,
one of the, the number one (1) thing in any town, and ours included, is property
maintenance. And we did do an early change of Code about a year ago, or maybe a
little bit more, when we passed three (3) different codes. One (1) was not allowing
people to park on the grass and the committee decided that the fallback position was
not to limit then the number of licensed and registered vehicles that could park in the
driveway. It was, I think a limit of four (4) prior to that. But we did amend the Code
and so there is no limit in the driveway and part of that Code also was for the people
who had campers or boats, not cars or, we allowed that side parking spot on the side of
the garage, that was also part of the Code change as well. And then the third (3rd)
Code change was the use of sports equipment in highways and rights-of-ways in
developments, so that was changed. So the information about you can park as many
licensed and registered vehicles in a driveway as possible is correct.

(From audience, Carol Burritt, 620 Shore Drive, “But they have to be parked in the
driveway, not half in and half off.”)
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Not a quarter out, exactly.

(From audience, Carol Burritt, 620 Shore Drive, “Correct.”)

But I just wanted to clarify.
