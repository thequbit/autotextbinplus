Seconded by

WHEREAS, after Notice was properly served upon the owners of 50 Faircrest

determine whether the property of 50 Faircrest Road constituted a Public Nuisance, and
WHEREAS, the owners of said property appeared at the Public Hearing and

WHEREAS, after hearing all testimony the Henrietta Town Board did declare said
property a Public Nuisance and ordered that the property be brought into compliance

IN THE MATTER OF
THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSED LOCAL LAW NO. 2 OF 2014:
A LOCAL LAW ESTABLISHING A TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
WHEREAS, the Henrietta Town Board previously passed resolutions requesting
that the New York State Legislature enact Legislation authorizing the Town of Henrietta
to implement a Taxpayer Assistance Program, and
WHEREAS, pursuant to New York State Legislation signed into Law on August 26,

Taxpayer Assistance Program, were delivered to each member of the Town Board, and
WHEREAS, due consideration has been given to the adoption of proposed Local

hearing should be held on the 17th day of September 2014 to consider the adoption of
proposed Local Law No. 2 of 2014.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that a Public Hearing shall be held on the 17th
day of September 2014 at 7:00 P.M. at the Town Hall, Main Meeting Room, 475 Calkins

WHEREAS, Tim Olsen and Carolyn Fisher of Suburban Animal Hospital wish to
donate $645.00 toward the purchase of a bench for the Henrietta Dog Park, and
WHEREAS, a check in the amount of $645.00 was received by the Town of
Henrietta Finance Department.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, the Town Board hereby acknowledges this

(Under discussion, Supervisor Moore stated that the Town would be paying for the
freight on the donated bench because it amounted to approximately $200.00 and it

also confirmed that an engraved plaque would be applied to the bench in recognition of
the donation.)

Seconded by

WHEREAS, the Town of Henrietta has received a purchase offer from Dorschel
Realty Corp. for the purchase of the 0.75 acres of land known as Telco Road, and
WHEREAS, the Commissioner of Public Works has advised the Town Board that
this roadway is no longer needed or used by the public and that the costs associated
with the repair and maintenance of same are a burden upon the Town, and
WHEREAS, after consideration the Town Board has determined that this parcel is
not needed or suitable for any other Town purpose, and
WHEREAS, the prospective purchaser has offered the full appraised value of
$35,000.00 plus various easements and other good and valuable consideration, and
WHEREAS, this money will be deposited into the general fund, and
WHEREAS, the transfer of ownership of said parcel where there is no material
change in conditions or activities constitutes a Type II action for SEQRA purposes and
does not have a significant effect on the environment and requires no further review.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that Telco Road be closed and discontinued as a
public highway, and removed from the list of public roads or highways within the Town
of Henrietta, and the same Telco Road is hereby abandoned by the Town of Henrietta.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Commissioner of Public Works is directed to
file with the Town Clerk his order closing and discontinuing said Telco Road, together
with a description of the area of said Telco Road so abandoned.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Dorschel Realty Corp. shall pay to the Town of
Henrietta as fair and reasonable value for said property the sum of $35,000.00 and
shall convey to the Town of Henrietta the easements specified in the contract of sale,
upon transfer of title of the area of Telco Road so abandoned.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Supervisor is hereby authorized to execute
any documents necessary to consummate said transfer of title, subject to the filing of a
petition for a permissive referendum.

(Under discussion, Supervisor Moore explained that Telco Road is a stub road off of
West Henrietta Road adjacent to the Dorschel properties and that by removing it from a
7

TB September 3, 2014

public road within the Town of Henrietta, taxpayer dollars would no longer have to be
used to provide maintenance on this road and it would be the responsibility of Dorschel
Realty Corp.)

SUPERVISOR MOORE
Discussion?

(Councilwoman Zinck explained that she grew up near the Witmers and knew how
dedicated they were to FISH and RHAFT and how deserving they are of this
recognition. She also stated that there is a dinner on September 10th celebrating 35
years for RHAFT and 45 years for FISH and at that dinner they are going to do a special
recognition for the Witmers pertaining to this Resolution. She hoped that the Witmers
would not read the Minutes from this Meeting and that people in the audience would
not share this with the Witmers prior to the dinner so that they would be surprised.)
