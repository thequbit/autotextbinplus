Ms.
Ciavaglia reported that the plaza is silty when windy.

Farash Campus for Jewish Education – For review of

A.

The Applicant stated the following:
1. This is a revision of a previous application. We revised the previous site
plan by relocating the school to the east and north.
2. The cut and fill ratio will require soil to be imported.
3. Storm runoff meets NYSDEC storm water regulations. The rear of the site
utilizes bio-retention methods while the front utilizes a new four (4) bay
storm pond.
4. Both the Town of Brighton and the Town of Henrietta will be reviewing
the application. Since most of the building structure is located in The
Town of Henrietta, its Planning Board has agreed to be Lead Agency.
5. The federal wetland located to the south will not be disturbed.
6. Landscape Plan LS100 dated 4/24/2014 was not included in the set, but is
now being submitted. (Attached to these minutes).
7. The design protects the southeast viewshed by not installing any high
plantings along the perimeter looking towards that portion of the Canal.
8. Trees will be provided along the driveway and drives throughout the
project; various types are shown.
9. Wetland plantings will be utilized at the new storm pond.
10. The Woodland Restoration Area identified on the plans will be utilized by
the building users for teaching classes and performing annual planting
ceremonies.
11. The gray areas on the plans will be low maintenance seeding.
12. Evergreens will be used for screening neighboring lots.
13. One hundred eighty-two (182) total trees are proposed on the site; fortyeight (48) trees will be provided for the 2.6 impervious acres located
within the Town of Henrietta.
14. New brush lines will be created using existing vegetation that is removed
and clear from the site.

B.

Henrietta Conservation Board recommends to the Planning Board:
1. Please require that all imported soil be certified clean, and either of a
similar type for the location and/or a proper type for the intended use.
2. The proposed tree density meets the Henrietta Conservation Board (HCB)
standard of eight (8) trees per impervious acre.
3. The HCB recommends maintaining less than fifty percent (50%) of any
tree species.
4. Consider revising asphalt layout of the south lot to increase green space.
5. Consider delineating wetlands with both signage and plantings.

showroom and not a distribution center.

plantings in wetter areas, and various colorful plantings throughout.

feet (35’) of surfaces treated with salt.

does not inhibit lighting design.
3. HCB agrees that this is a good use of space, yet maintaining at least
twenty-five percent (25%) green space.
4. HCB requests review of future subdivision lot number two (2) when plans
are proposed.
