SUPERVISOR MOORE
We have two (2) Public Hearings tonight. The first (1st) one will be on Local Law No. 4
of 2014, it’s a Local Law Amending the Town Code to allow New York State Town Law
§278 Cluster Subdivisions to be permitted in a Rural Residential District. Our Deputy

TB December 3, 2014
Supervisor, if you could explain what that entails please.
PETER MINOTTI, DEPUTY TOWN SUPERVISOR / PLANNING BOARD CHAIRMAN
Mr. Supervisor, members of the Board, good evening and for the record, Peter Minotti,
Deputy Town Supervisor and Planning Board Chairman. It was during my review of the
Trail View Subdivision, which is going to be located on Ward Hill Road, on the south
side directly across from Heritage Hills Subdivision and Branch Brook Drive, that I
discovered that in the Code that applying New York State Town Law §278 Zoning to the
existing Rural Residential Zoning, is not permissible, I would humbly submit. I would
offer under Code section 295-59B, if the Supervisor would indulge me, it states that,
“The Planning Board shall have the powers and duties prescribed by the applicable
provisions of the Town Law, including the powers set forth in §278 of the Town Law,”
but at the bottom of the same paragraph it says, “The powers delegated to the
Planning Board herein shall apply to all Districts Zoned R-1 and R-2,” and I would note
the absence of any mention of the Rural Residential Districts, both one (1) and two (2).
When I mentioned this to the Supervisor, he asked me to contact the Planning Board
Attorney; I did that. Mr. Walker at first was somewhat skeptical, but he advised me he
would take it under consideration, he contacted our Town Attorney and I think Mr.
Mastrella, he did later meet with you.
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
Correct.
PETER MINOTTI, DEPUTY TOWN SUPERVISOR / PLANNING BOARD CHAIRMAN
And while, with all due respect, you may have a difference of opinion with the Planning
Board Attorney, he has asked us to amend this existing Town Law to simply include R1, R-2 and all Rural Residential one (RR-1) and Rural Residential two (RR-2) Zoning, so
that is just a brief overview, Mr. Supervisor…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay. Thank you.
PETER MINOTTI, DEPUTY TOWN SUPERVISOR / PLANNING BOARD CHAIRMAN
…of how we got to where we are this evening.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Did you want to add anything, Dan?
DANIEL MASTRELLA, TOWN ATTORNEY
No, I think that Mr. Minotti explained it pretty well.

2

TB December 3, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. I have one (1) person that signed up to speak on this. Mr. Moffitt, if you’d
like to come to the microphone.
PETER MINOTTI, DEPUTY TOWN SUPERVISOR / PLANNING BOARD CHAIRMAN
Mr. Supervisor, if I may, at the podium, Mr. Moffitt come on up, at the podium I have
included the original Resolution of the Town Law from July of 2005, and I have also
included the actual Law itself, that Mr. Mastrella filed with Department of State.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Thank you.
PETER MINOTTI, DEPUTY TOWN SUPERVISOR / PLANNING BOARD CHAIRMAN
So any resident that is interested, we have all the documentation for you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, thank you.
PETER MINOTTI, DEPUTY TOWN SUPERVISOR / PLANNING BOARD CHAIRMAN
You’re welcome.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
How’s everybody doing tonight?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Good. We need…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Good.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…your name and address please.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Craig Robert Moffitt, 81 Finnegan Way, 14467. You should have that memorized by
now, right Rebecca?
REBECCA WIESNER, TOWN CLERK / RECEIVER OF TAXES
Yes.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Well, thank you all for listening, Jack, can we ask questions?
3

TB December 3, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
If I can answer them, I’d be glad to.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I actually, we asked you to come on in earlier and talk to Peter and I so we could clarify
some things for you, but you declined.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay. So amending and including, how does that impact septic system versus sewers?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, five (5) acres would mean you would have a septic system, if you have a five (5)
acre lot, and two (2) acres would mean you would be on sewers, and when you look at
a two (2) acre lot, in a cluster zoning you’re going to build on, we’ll say a ten to fifteen
thousand square foot (10,000 – 15,000 sq. ft.) lot, so that all the buildings are going to
be condensed on one (1) portion of the property. But if you were building fifty (50)
homes, there would still be one hundred (100) acres total that would be kept in tack, so
fifty (50) times whatever the ten thousand square foot (10,000 sq. ft.) lots would be on
one (1) corner and the rest of the parcel would be open space that could be enjoyed by
the community.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
How does the developer, he/she has a choice now, pending, in those areas that you’re
going to amend, if there’s a sewer line there already, then they’re going to use the
sewer. But now they have a choice to use septic or sewer, is that correct, or am I way
off?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
They’ve always had that choice, it would just be, would it be cost prohibitive for the
developer to bring in the sewer? So without sewer it has to be a five (5) acre lot,
unless they go to a cluster, but in most cases, the County Health Department is going
to way in and they’re going to have a say in what size lots are, depending on the perc
test.
4

TB December 3, 2014
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay. And then you probably know where I’m going with this, over at Goodburlet Road
and East Henrietta Road. Would that particular development…?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You’re on the wrong side of the Thruway. Rural Residential Zoning is only on the south
side of the Thruway.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
So anything north of the Thruway is just our regular type of lot size.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
So with that potential project, if it does happen at Goodburlet Road and East Henrietta
Road, in that area, if it’s on the north side of the Thruway and you’re going to cluster
there, because the other project was shot down because it was too many apartments,
people didn’t want it there, now it’s going to be seventy five (75) patio homes at a cost
of somewhere in the mid two hundred and fifty thousand dollar ($250,000.00) range,
how does our RR cluster, nothing to do with that?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
No. §278 Cluster is one thing, and that allows a developer to build on smaller lots in a
condensed format so that they don’t have as much infrastructure cost, the road costs
won’t be as great, and the Town will have less cost in maintaining that going forward.
But in exchange for being allowed to cluster those homes, they’re going to have to
maintain a certain amount of open space to offset what they were forgiven by being
able to cluster.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s nothing. §278 is nothing more than a trade off in which the developer has less cost
for infrastructure but the community benefits from the additional open space that’s
going to be available to people.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.

5

TB December 3, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s really a, to me, a very good thing going forward, especially in our rural areas…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…because now you won’t build over one hundred (100) acres and put fifty (50) homes
on it.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You will build on twenty or twenty five (20 – 25) of those acres and we’ll see three
quarters (3/4) or half (1/2) of that open space.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Yes, and in a lot of cases it could be a lot more attractive…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Right.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…with the RR.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s really what the Rural Residential was intended for, it’s just that in 2005 when the
Law was enacted, it didn’t allow the Planning Board the authority to grant §278
clusters. The Town Board has had that authority in the past.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
So the only thing we’re changing is, we’re handing off that authority to the Planning
Board, by changing this Local Law. And we have Town Council here saying we didn’t
have to do it because he thought we covered it, but we had Planning Board Attorney
saying, yes you do have to cover it, so we’re just trying to cover our bases and do the
right thing.

6

TB December 3, 2014
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay, and I’m glad. Thank you. I’m sorry I didn’t take you up on your invitation, I did
however try Monday night, I thought the Workshop was going to be right here, and
then everybody disappeared, and I’m like, “Where’d they go?”
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, we made an announcement that the heating system here’s a little difficult and we
were going to do our business part of the Meeting back in the conference room, of
which probably you didn’t hear.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay. So, if I’m…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But I’m sorry…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
…going to shoot my big mouth off, I want to have the facts instead of just hunting and
pecking and I…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, that’s why we kind of offered for you to come in, but you told me you thought we
should make a house call instead.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Right. (Laughter)
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Well, and I apologize because I noticed you were at our first Meeting (1st) and I noticed
you were at our third (3rd) Meeting, but it was when I noticed you at our third (3rd)
Meeting that I realized you didn’t come in the middle.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We didn’t…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
I didn’t hear…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
I missed, I, yes.

7

TB December 3, 2014
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Anyways…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes, but we had a chair saved for you in the conference room.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay, so from now on with the Workshop, where are they?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, it depends. We have A.V. equipment here that we can utilize, so if we have a
power point presentation from a developer, we will do it out here…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…but until there’s more people that come to our Workshops than what we can
accommodate in the conference room, we’ll do it in the conference room.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
A safe bet is always to ask the Clerk’s desk.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes, and I mean…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…every Meeting we have is open, so don’t ever think that just because we move, you
can’t find where we are.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Alright, so one (1) final point on the amendment with the Planning Board and with, and
the changes that are going to be up, I did, I’m sure you’re all aware of it, I know most
of you were on the Town Board at the time while the comprehensive plan was being
written…

8

TB December 3, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, no actually the 2011 update, some of us were here for, I don’t think…
COUNCILMAN BREESE
Well, I wasn’t.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
You weren’t.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
We weren’t here for the 2002. Well, Bill was. Janet was.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
I was.
PETER MINOTTI, DEPUTY TOWN SUPERVISOR / PLANNING BOARD CHAIRMAN
Bill and I were Chairmen.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
The rest of us weren’t. And Peter was a big part of that along with John Schmidt out in
the audience…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Well…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…that helped enable a lot of this Rural Residential Zoning that we’re enacting…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…or working on. And this Rural Residential is the first (1st) time since 2005 that
anybody has decided to develop under that legislation.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Okay. Well, I just wanted to make two (2) points from the information I was able to
find off the Henrietta.org website. I have, I guess I have stuff from 2004 that’s no
longer appropriate, but it does say here that fifty-five percent (55%) of the people that
responded to that comprehensive thumbnail plan that’s not Law, okay, Comprehensive
Plan is not a Law, it’s just a thumbnail sketch for you guys, you can do whatever you
want, but fifty-five percent (55%) are very concerned about agriculture and open
9

TB December 3, 2014
space, which I continually see disappearing more and more in Henrietta. It concerns
me a little bit.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, I can probably address that better than most here having, or still own some of the
agricultural land left. First (1st) off where I think we’re all very concerned with open
space, that’s why we went to the Rural Residential Zoning, and we work with our
Comprehensive Plan every day when it comes to a development, that’s part of the Bible
that the Deputy Supervisor carries around, and we try to adhere to it, but anybody that
owns land does have the right to develop it as long as they do it according to our
zoning and local laws…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Of course, sure.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…we’re somewhat bound by that. We can’t tell somebody, “No you can’t develop it.”
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Like the property you talk about at Goodburlet Road and East Henrietta Road, the
Winslow sisters own that and it’s part of their retirement, and there’s thirty (30) acres
there that nobody’s developed forever, and I think we have a good project there that
will probably work and I think the neighbors will actually be pretty happy with it. Of
which, when we had our Meeting with the Town Board and developer on Monday night,
any neighbors that were there I thought were very pleased with what they saw.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
And I was here too and I was also, except of course it’s out of my financial reach, but
I’m more concerned about south of the Thruway…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But again, Craig, we can’t tell a developer, “You can’t build homes in our Town that cost
any more than two hundred thousand ($200,000.00)…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
I understand.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…it’s an open market and they have to build something that they can afford to build…
10

TB December 3, 2014
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
And that they think…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…so that they can…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…someone will buy.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…sell and make money.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Right. But, it’s…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well you, but you made reference to different…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
…disappearing. That’s all, that’s my point that Henrietta just…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Can I just add one thing to, you just made mention to something from the survey and I
think there was another important question asked. In the survey you said, what fifty
five percent (55%) of the people were concerned about…
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
That responded to the survey.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…open space. There was also a very high statistic when asked, “Do you want the Town
spending money to be able to acquire, to…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Development rights.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…yes, for what?
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Development rights.

11

TB December 3, 2014
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Development rights, things like that, and the answer was, “No.”
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Well sure.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
So, I think yes there was concern as there is from us…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well actually…
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
…but we also got a strong message, but don’t spend any money on it.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Actually, I think in 2005 when this Rural Residential was enacted, being a landowner, I
would tell you they took a lot of money out of landowner’s pockets for future
development, but they did the community a great favor because very little land’s been
developed south of the Thruway because of the Legislation they put in, and it’s
working, and I’m actually proud of it today, even though it cost a lot of landowners
money.
CRAIG MOFFITT, 81 FINNEGAN WAY
Well, I understand your positions and I just wanted to voice, just maybe a gentle
reminder that it’s disappearing in Henrietta quickly. I’m not a financial expert, I don’t
see where the Town is in any financial hardship to need more of a tax base, and I’ll
leave it at that and I thank you very much for listening to me, and have a great night.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. The next Public Hearing we have is for a property cleanup at 3236 East
Henrietta Road, and if Mr. Ekwell would come up and explain what we’re trying to do.
TERRY EKWELL, FIRE MARSHAL / BUILDING INSPECTOR
Terry Ekwell, Director of Building and Fire Prevention, Town of Henrietta. We’ve had a
property at 3236 East Henrietta Road that has an unoccupied barn that’s been in a
state of deterioration for a number of years as is there another number of barns and
storage buildings of this type around Town that are in the same situation that we are
now aggressively going after to bring them down. The big concern is it’s an unsafe
12

TB December 3, 2014
structure and it’s unsafe according to the Property Maintenance Code of State of New
York, Chapter 1, Subsection 107.1.1, which says, “An unsafe structure that is found to
be dangerous to the life, health, property or safety of the public by not providing
minimum safeguards to protect or warn occupants in the event of a fire, or because the
structure contains unsafe equipment or is so damaged, decayed, dilapidated,
structurally unsafe, or of such faulty construction or unstable foundation, that partial or
complete collapse is possible.” This is what’s going on with the barn. It’s, like I said,
been deteriorating for a number of years. It’s been getting progressively worse from
the road and from the property to the south, which is the Good Shepherd Church
property, we could see large openings in both the roof, the exterior side walls, and with
a barn type construction, it’s only a matter of time that once you take the strength out
of the roof, then you lose the strength of the exterior four (4) corners of the walls and
then the building will collapse. The problem is when it collapses and what direction.
The wind could blow it over, that could happen. We have other barns on Middle Road
and over on John Street that are in similar conditions that we are actively going after,
so I brought it to the Board’s attention that we should look to have an action taken on
this property, and a letter was sent to the property owner November 13th asking them
to come here tonight and explain what, if anything they can do to work an action plan
together to take care of this structure at this point in time.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, thank you.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Thanks.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Would the property owner please come to the podium.
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Good evening.

SUPERVISOR MOORE
And…
HELENE MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
And Helene Marlowe.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…we talked yesterday and…
HELENE MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…you were going to come back with a plan, so if you could help the Board understand
what you’d like to do.
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Okay. Well, we’ve known the barn needed repair, it’s just a matter of two (2) things;
finances and finding somebody that could tell us what needed to be done, whether it
was beyond repair or not. We did have one contractor that did some work on our
house this summer and he said that it could be fixed, so we’ve been trying to
investigate our options and when we got the summons I decided we’d better step it up
a notch. I hired Sickles Corporation, who’s done work on my property before, and done
work in Henrietta; he says most of you people should probably know him, Jim Sickles,
to come and look at the barn and determine whether it’s fixable or it should be torn
down. And if it’s fixable he would do the work, and if it’s not, then we would progress
from there.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
How much time do you think this would take you to make a determination?
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Probably not more than a couple of months, I know he’s still got some houses he’s
finishing up, so that’s what he told me.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
When your wife and I talked, probably about six (6) months maybe would work a little
better for you?
HELENE MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Yes…

14

TB December 3, 2014
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Oh, that would be more than enough, I would think.
HELENE MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
…I think so.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I think that if you could get with Mr. Ekwell and talk to him a little bit about it and
figure out how we could maybe address that and I also said that if you get to a point
where you don’t think that maybe you could financially do it, that potentially there
might be somebody that we could find to repurpose that barn someplace else for you,
and that I would be glad to help you with that because the Amish and the Mennonite
community a lot of times will take a barn like that and take it down and reconstruct it
someplace and continue to use it.
HELENE MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And I’d be glad to help you with that.
HELENE MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Okay, thank you.
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
There’s a lot of excellent lumber in there and huge beams, and they seem to be
structurally okay, for the most part, so…
HELENE MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Oh yes.
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
…I’m sure somebody could get use out of it.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s just a safety issue that the neighbors felt needed to be addressed, and this is the
medium in which we address that, and we’re only looking to have a partnership where
we can fix things.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
So when will Mr. Sickles be coming to actually look at it, though?

15

TB December 3, 2014
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
He said sometime in the next couple of weeks. I actually took pictures to show him,
but he didn’t get a chance to look at them yet, but he’s closing out a house in Brighton
right now, and he’s still very busy but he knows it a “time of the essence” thing, so he
said he’d get to it.
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Repairing barns is very expensive.
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Yes, I’m sure it is.
HELENE MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Yes.
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
He just renovated an entire barn out in Avon for the Howletts, I don’t know if you know
who they are, but so he’s pretty familiar with everything that’s needed so if he says it’s
going to be too expensive, or if it’s not worth it, then we’ll…
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Thank you.
COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
Go to plan b.
DONALD MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
Yes.
HELENE MARLOWE, 3236 EAST HENRIETTA ROAD
We actually were not aware of the roof until this spring when we had a really bad wind
storm because the roof that’s bad doesn’t face our house and one of our neighbors told
us about it and was nice about it and he said, “I was picking up pieces,” and he showed
me and I couldn’t believe it. So we were not aware it was that bad until then.
SUPERVISOR MOORE

SUPERVISOR MOORE
That concludes the business part of our Meeting. The public comment session, we
have one (1) signed up, Dave Christensen.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
Thank you. Dave Christensen, I reside at 1456 Calkins Road. Two (2) weeks ago I
handed out a project that I’ve been working on. One (1) of the Members up here said
I’d been working on it for many years, and I had. It’s a situation with, that this pertains
to the speed and the traffic coming down Calkins Road, specifically in the fourteen
hundred (1400) block between the Town line and Pinnacle Road. First (1st) let me ask
you, has there been any more correspondence from the Monroe County Sheriff’s
Department?

23

TB December 3, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
No, the only correspondence, and it’s been verbal, was with our County Legislator John
Howland, and I gave him a copy of your report and also a copy of the report the
Captain of the B Zone had given me.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
Okay, and I saw…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I was trying to get him to have some buy in and see if he could carry it through the
County for you.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
And I’d still like him to get him to have some buy in because again, I’m in firm belief
that if we inspect the speeds coming down there it will affect what people are doing.
That report that you’re discussing showed in a one (1) week period, twenty-four (24)
hours a day, there were three hundred (300), thirty thousand (30,000) cars coming
down that hill just strictly west bound. Twenty thousand (20,000) of them were going
over the speed limit. That’s a case where the fact that every thirty (30) seconds
somebody is breaking the law coming down that hill.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Are you referring to the Captain’s report?
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
Yes.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But, I believe, and I don’t know the percentage because I don’t remember that, but
most of them were less than five (5) miles over the speed limit, which they don’t write
tickets for.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
That, there was, that exactly. And in fact if you take that, if everybody over five (5)
miles an hour over the speed limit, you still would have tickets written in a one (1)
week period totaling about half a million dollars ($500,000.00). I subtracted the five
(5) out, Jack, so the fact, yes I know they don’t write at five (5), I even worked with
ideas of ten (10). That doesn’t preclude, there’s still a safety hazard down there
because there are also five (5) people, three (3) I believe going forty-one (41) miles an
hour over the speed limit. Those are ticket writing periods on the expressway or the
Thruway. What I’m asking here, has the Town considered my request to do a letter to
the Sheriff’s Department to enhance the traffic enforcement there? If not, any
24

TB December 3, 2014
guidance from the Town Board would be appreciated. I’ve done this for many years,
I’ve relied on people doing what they said, they haven’t previously enforced things, this
time I’m not letting go. I’m going to keep going.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And that’s why I went ahead and contacted John Howland and he has been very
receptive and I’m waiting for him to see what he can do with the Sheriff.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
Okay. Would it be appropriate for me to contact him also?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Oh, sure. That’d be great.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
Okay, I will do that. I’m looking again for the support, thank you for contacting
Howland, I still would like to keep Captain Wagner in this situation, but understand I’m
going to keep continuing this now, I’m not going to drop it as I have over the last few
years because it’s just getting worse. I will tell you on Monday at two fifteen (2:15
P.M.), while stopping to get my mail, the lady hit the cones. They were painting the
center lines, she hit a cone, she trapped it underneath her PT Cruiser, she parked one
(1) foot in the road, two hundred feet (200’) from the crest of that hill, and then
crawled under her car on the driver’s side trying to get it out. Her legs were laying in
the road. I’m running up, I’m waving cars off that are coming over the hill, and I’ve got
her license number and make and model if you want it, you can call her and, look it up
and call her and ask her. She was laying in the road. There’s no cure for stupid, but in
this case it would have taken just one (1) car two (2) seconds to come over the hill and
take her legs off.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Wow.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
So, again I’m serious. I’ll get ahold of Howland. Is there any other suggestions that
you can make for me going forward to try and make Henrietta a safer place?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well the Captain will be back in this Friday and I’ll reaffirm with him what you and I
talked about.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
Would you like to have a joint meeting?
25

TB December 3, 2014
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I could set one up if you want.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
I’ll swing by.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, call…
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
Let me know when.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…call my Administrative Assistant so that we make sure it gets coordinated.
DAVID CHRISTENSEN, 1456 CALKINS ROAD
She has been wonderful, by the way, and I’d like that on Record. Thank you so much
for your time, the opportunity, and I wish you all well.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Thank you, Dave.
