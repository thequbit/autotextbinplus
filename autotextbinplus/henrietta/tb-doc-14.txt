Three (3) Special Permits – September 17, 2014 – 6:30 P.M.

There was a general discussion about each of the Board Members’ feelings on
SP2014-029, Fastrac Markets. Supervisor Moore stated that if there are not three (3) Aye
votes at Wednesday’s Special Permit Meeting, Board Members would be responsible for
creating Findings of Fact as to why they voted no, because a “No” vote would not be
defensible in court. Councilman Mulligan said he was still going to vote “No.”

Proposed Rezoning of Land Located at 3860 East River Road from

Meeting. Prior to the Town Board Meeting, there will be a neighborhood meeting at the
Department of Public Works building at 6:00 p.m. Supervisor Moore has heard from RIT,
and they are going to speak against the project due to the threat of competition.

Proposed Local Law No. 2 of 2014: A Local Law Establishing a
Taxpayer Assistance Program

Chase is going to be charging the Town $1.00/check to print out each of the checks to
residents. It will take one day to get the checks printed.
1.) Approval of Minutes at Town Board meeting(s)
2.) Consider Calling for Public Hearing – Rental Registry – Gabbert
Nate Gabbert, Town Assessor, had a rough draft on a local law from Greece regarding a
rental registry that could be used as a guide for creating our own local law. Supervisor

TB Workshop September 15, 2014
Moore stated that in the next Henrietta Happenings, he was going to have a section asking
people to notify his office if there are any rentals near them. The proposed local law will
state that inspection is required every three (3) years. Councilwoman Zinck and
Councilman Page expressed an interest in adding a statement about inspection every
three (3) years or if there’s a tenant change, but Terry Ekwell, Fire Marshal/Building
Inspector, and Daniel Mastrella, Town Attorney, felt that that would not be feasible as
there would be no way for the Town to know if there was a tenant change unless the
landlord volunteered that information. Terry Ekwell clarified that the Town is able to gain
access to a rental property if there are any property maintenance violations.
3.) Consider Authorizing Special Permit Extension – SP2013-057: West
Herr Automotive to construct a 240 space overflow parking area –
Martin
The location of the overflow parking area is north of the new building going up.
Councilman Breese made a motion to grant a six (6) month extension to West Herr
Automotive Group’s Special Use Permit from the original expiration date. Councilwoman
Zinck seconded the motion. The new expiration date will be March 12, 2015.

Rouge Road have been resolved. He also gave an update on how many code violations
that have been written so far this year; it has been 991 so far. They have also mowed
144 lawns, 100 less from last year.

The proposed no parking area would be on school days from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. to
enable school buses to get around the cul-de-sac. During the winter there’s already no
parking on the street so there’s no concern about snow plows getting around the
cul-de-sac. The Town Board agreed that they were interested in calling for a public
hearing regarding the proposed no parking area.

of Public Works – Wiesner / Eckert

on October 4th.

they could use to cite as a violation.

warned that they had their first strike and that if any additional complaints were filed with
the Town, their permit would be revoked. The Town of Henrietta has had lots of issues
with solicitor permits in general and there was a discussion about not allowing any solicitor
permits.
17.) Info Only: New Mail Collection Service – Wiesner
The Town of Henrietta will now be utilizing IMS, Inc’s First Class Pre-Sort Program to save
money on postage. Rather than using the standard first class postage rates of $0.48 for
mail up to 1 ounce and $0.69 for mail up to 2 ounces, all mail up to 6” x 9” and under 2
ounces will be metered at $0.435.

Since the Town’s first legal notice regarding the dog census on July 4th weekend, the Town
Clerk’s Office has issued 993 new dog licenses. During the same time period the previous
year, 125 new dog licenses were issued. As of 9:00 a.m. on September 15th, the Town
has a total of 4,709 licensed dogs. The census is scheduled to start on September 22nd at
