TOWN BOARD ORGANIZATIONAL WORKSHOP MEETING NOTES
DECEMBER 29, 2014
The regularly scheduled Organizational Workshop of the Henrietta Town Board for
Monday, December 29, 2014 was called to order at 4:00 P.M.
MEMBERS PRESENT

Rebecca Wiesner, Town Clerk/Receiver of Taxes

GUESTS/RESIDENTS PRESENT

MEMBERS ABSENT
Councilman William J. Mulligan, Jr.
Daniel J. Mastrella, Town Attorney
-Discuss/Adopt Fee and Wage Schedule – 2014/2015 Winter/Spring Season –
Henrietta Recreation Department
Jason Kulik, Director of Parks & Recreation, reported to the Town Board that the
Recreation Department programming fees fluctuate from season to season and that the
Winter/Spring fees have already been set for the programs that run through the end of
April. The Recreation Department brochure is mailed out three (3) times a year so Kulik
offered up two (2) different suggestions for how to handle the Recreation Department
fees going forward: 1) prior to mailing out the Recreation Department brochure, the fees
can be approved by the Town Board; or 2) the Town Board could enable Kulik to set the
fees. Supervisor Moore said that after talking to the Town Attorney, there is no
requirement to set the Recreation Department fees at the Organizational Meeting and that
they could be set at a later date as more time may be needed to evaluate the fees being
charged. Barbara Chirdo, Director of Finance, stated that the Recreation Department
fees that were adopted at last year’s Organizational Meeting is not what was actually
charged. Kulik said that he would like the fees to be set so that there is consistency from
program to program; currently there is no consistency in how the fees are set.
Councilman Page suggested discussing the fees before the brochure is printed and
adopting them via Town Board Resolution. Kulik mentioned that additional registration
information would be released on January 19th, so Supervisor Moore told him to come
back with the fees to present to the Town Board at the January 5th Workshop Meeting.
