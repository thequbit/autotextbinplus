SUPERVISOR MOORE
That concludes the business part of the Meeting and I have some speakers signed up.
The first (1st) speaker for Public Comment section would be Jeff Kueppers.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Good evening, Mr. Supervisor and respected Council. How you doing?
DONALD A. YOUNG, ESQ, TOWN ATTORNEY
Good.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Welcome to our Town.
DONALD A. YOUNG, ESQ, TOWN ATTORNEY
Sir, I’ve been here for a while. Thank you.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I don’t recognize you. Sorry about that. I’m used to Mastrella. Okay then. Our Town,
whoa, hey now, there we go. Our Town’s concerns. What happened to communication
between Mr. Supervisor, Deputy Supervisor, Town Board and Town Engineers to the
residents? Supervisor Mr. Moore tabled the last discussion the residents attended. We
asked to be notified as to your decision during the Town Meeting. Since we the people
of Henrietta can’t trust you anymore, we demand that these questions be officially
responded to in writing and within a reasonable time. Mr. Supervisor, Town Council,
why did no one from the Town of Henrietta contact us, contact us, as to your decision
after your closed, after you closed the door on Henrietta residents. The concerned
residents signed in to the Town Meetings with our name and phone numbers, they
were given so you didn’t have any doubt who was concerned. Mr. Supervisor, did you
ever find out who removed the petition from, the petition and other supporting
documents from Town Records? This was in the file to help future developers know
this is a sensitive area. Mr. Supervisor, did you ever find out who filled in the swamp
illegally? Why not? Mr. Supervisor and Town Council, what is the condition of the gas
station, On the Run Mobile, on the corner of Bailey and West Henrietta Road? This is a
chance to be honest because we already know the answer. Mr. Supervisor and Town
Council, did you ever consider if there is an accident? How about an explosion? Mr.
Supervisor and Town Council, have you ever considered the safety of Henrietta
residents? What research was conducted for impacts for gas stations next to residential
neighborhoods? Mr. Supervisor, when did the ban get lifted for gas stations? And who
is responsible for the decision? Mr. Supervisor, when and how were the residents
notified of your decision to lift the ban on gas stations? Mr. Supervisor and Town
Council, will the Town be taking soil and water samples from the surrounding area
concerning the new Fastrac gas station, or will you be leaving that up to the residents?
6

TB April 1, 2015
Mr. Supervisor and Council, what fines and conditions do you have in place to protect
Henrietta residents from noise pollution, pollution, chemical spills, environmental
damages, explosions? Mr. Supervisor and Town Council, when you decide to practice in
the dark, you do not publically state your changes to the moratorium or any practice in
the dark, you are creating an air of deception. What did you decide about enforcing
Town Codes? A fifty foot (50’) buffer plus the ten feet (10’) the Town owns, that’s sixty
feet (60’) total, that’s the law. Transparency in government, where is it, Mr.
Supervisor? Why not use the Town’s Henrietta Happenings magazine or the Henrietta’s
webpage to communicate to residents about our concerns? Mr. Supervisor, Town
Council, and Mr. Lawyer, I’m sorry about that, I make reference to Mr. Mastrella in
here, please explain in writing how it is beneficial for Henrietta residents to cooperate
with Henrietta Town officials when Henrietta residents don’t cooperate with Town
officials, 1997 we were successful in defending our environment, there is no two (2)
story office building over there. Henrietta residents cooperate with the Town in 2014
and we get a gas station. We the people of the Town of Henrietta have rights to enjoy
an equal opportunity to participate fully in cultural and intellectual life of this state. Mr.
Supervisor, Jack Moore, Mr. Deputy Supervisor, Peter Minotti, and Town Council and
Town Engineers, you have denied the residents of their rights. We expect the highest
standards of integrity, efficiency and accountability. You have been found lacking. Civil
unrest has begun. You, Mr. Supervisor, and respected Town Council, are the, are
responsible for Henrietta’s residents being stuck between a rock and a gas station. We
have ethics violations committed by officials that are concerning for the Henrietta
residents. From the New York State Inspector General, Catherine Leahy Scott’s office,
states, “New York State’s residents are entitled to a government that is committed to
the highest standards of integrity, efficiency, and accountability. We in the office of the
State Inspector General have been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring that…

(Bell ring, five (5) minutes)
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…the state officials and employees meet these fundamentally important standards. It is
a responsibility they take very seriously.” Therefore, we the people of Henrietta are
officially requesting that a grievance be filed on behalf of the residents of Henrietta
concerning the time sensitive communications between the residents and Town Officials
that we did not receive until all time constraints expired. Thank you for your time and
considerations and God bless us all, sincerely, Jeffrey Kueppers, the Henrietta residents’
representative.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you Jeff.

(Applause)

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “Good job, Jeff. Good job.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
The next speaker is Tom Mahatcke. (Pause, no response) Lynne Stewart.
LYNNE STEWART, 225 VISCOUNT DRIVE
Thank you.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
You’re welcome. It’s nice to meet you.
DONALD A. YOUNG, ESQ, TOWN ATTORNEY
Sure.
LYNNE STEWART, 225 VISCOUNT DRIVE
I received this in the mail from you the other day in the, in my paper box.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Ma’am you have to…
LYNNE STEWART, 225 VISCOUNT DRIVE
Oh, I’m sorry, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive. I received this in our newspaper box
and this is the first I’ve heard of it, and I’m sorry, I apologize, I don’t remember
Meetings in June, and I get all the Minutes from everything and I would have been here
to talk about this. Mr. Kueppers has already brought up questions that he had
information on this, so if I’m repeating anything, I’m sorry. Where’s the report from the
Army Corps of Engineers, I would ask. Why are you filling in a swamp? I was at
Cracker Barrel today, now I realize where this is. What’s Wilmorite doing messing
around? We know Wilmorite and the Wilmont family has done some other things in the
state about casinos. I don’t understand the thing about the two (2) story office
building, that’s, don’t, but, what about all this stuff that was buried under the ground
and hasn’t been dug up, let’s see, where is that on here? I want to know more about
the Wegmans, or behind Wegmans, the old Wegmans. What about the ancient burial
ground for Native Americans that go, and the trail apparently went all the way down
the hill, a migration trail, close to where this Fastrac will be, or maybe on that land, and
again why wasn’t the contaminated fill examined? It says here an anthropology
department from a college has commented on this. Okay. That’s, sorry I don’t know
more, but that’s my question, questions.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Just to, maybe clarify the idea that there wasn’t any notification on this project, it
started on the third (3rd) of June and it ended on the twenty-second (22nd) of October.

TB April 1, 2015
There were six (6) mailings to residents, there were four (4) legal notices posted not
only in the Henrietta Post but also on our website, and there were eleven (11) Public
Meetings.

(From audience, Lynne Steward, 225 Viscount Drive, “And I’m sorry I didn’t get, I
would have gotten one by Zoning and Conservation and…”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, all I can do is…

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “She’s not the only one though because then I
put…”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
All I can do is go by the Record and…

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “I didn’t get any.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…and it went from Town Board to Planning Board to Zoning Board.

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “I know for a fact that not everyone in this Town
got notices.”)
(From audience, unidentified speaker, “I didn’t get anything because [inaudible] mail.”)
(From audience, multiple people all speaking at once)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well I’m not here to debate whether you didn’t or you did, all I’m trying to show is that
it was a public, and Jeff was at every single one of them.

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “Because Jeff got a letter, but not
everyone got a letter.”)
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Excuse me, hang on a moment, I am your representative and I have to let you know
that without their communicating to me in a timely manner we weren’t able to defend
that property.

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “That is correct.”)
9

TB April 1, 2015

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “Okay, Jeff you just have, you be point.”)
(From audience, unidentified speaker, “That is correct.”)
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
So, when you, when these people have a concern, I know I signed in at every Meeting
and I was hoping that you would just call me back so then I could communicate to the
rest of the team so then they can go about our community and tell the rest of the
Town. So, by eliminating me, just me, from the thing, you could have called just me
instead of all the people that signed that paper…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
There was no elimination, Jeff, I mean you been here numerous times.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
But you excommunicated us when you had ever mean to, and if these people are telling
you that they didn’t hear it, then somehow the ways you have been trying to
communicate are failing.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, we have our website and we have our Legal Notice paper.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I understand that, but obviously these good people that don’t hear you, don’t.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. The last speaker signed up is Mike Stafford.

(From audience, Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive, “I didn’t sign up.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You didn’t?

(Inaudible)

SUPERVISOR MOORE
We have two (2) more.

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “Can you answer the question
about the burial ground, please?”)
10

TB April 1, 2015
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, this is a Public Comment session, so I don’t, I’m not sure I know what burial
ground you’re talking about Lynne. There’s no burial ground on Hylan Drive that I’m
aware of.

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “It says…”)
(From audience, unidentified speaker, “[inaudible]”)
(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “…behind the old Wegmans.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But that, we’re not talking about the old Wegmans site, I’m sorry. We’re talking about
Hylan Drive.

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “But the migration trail went all the
way toward where the Fastrac is…”)
(From audience, Jeff Kueppers, 108 Summer Sky Drive, “It went from Rush to
Fairport.”)
(From audience, unidentified speaker, “We don’t know how far it went.”)
(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “He mentions the moratorium. I
remember years ago there was a moratorium on gas stations. Why did that change? I
don’t...”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It hasn’t, there isn’t a moratorium on gas stations, the only thing that happened was
they changed gas station possibilities of being built from commercial land in 1989 to it
could be built on industrial land or planned commercial districts, and Marketplace Mall is
the only planned commercial district we have in Town, of which where the Fastrac site
is now, that’s part of that planned commercial district and that was zoned commercial
back when they did Marketplace Mall in 1979 or 1980.

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “The one that’s on the corner of
Calkins and West Henrietta Road.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
No, I’m talking about Hylan Drive now, ma’am.

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “Okay, that’s…”)
11

TB April 1, 2015
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay?

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “…a new one.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Correct, but…

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “That’s considered Marketplace
Mall land?”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Where we’re building the Fastrac site, yes. Okay?

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “Oh.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
And that zoning was set in 1979.

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “Okay.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, and it was zoned for the type of use it’s being used for. You’re making a
reference to the gas station on the corner of Calkins and NY 15, that is on commercial
land, but they went to the Zoning Board and got a variance for that, much like they did
for the one on Jefferson Road almost to John Street.

(From audience, Lynne Stewart, 225 Viscount Drive, “Okay.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay?
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Who grants their variances, by the way?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
The Zoning Board.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Okay.

TB April 1, 2015
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Okay, there’s…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
We’ll help direct our attention.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I’m sorry?
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
It will help direct our attention.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, there was no variance granted on Hylan Drive.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I’m just running out of things to avenues to chase you guys with and that’ll be the
next…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, there’s, Jeff, there’s no chasing. This has been a public meeting throughout, I
mean…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I understand.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…when we have eleven (11) Public Meetings…

(From audience, April Sierra, 92 Summer Sky Drive, “Why weren’t we notified? Like
I…”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I don’t know where you live to start with, so I’m sorry, but we’re…

(From audience, April Sierra, 92 Summer Sky Drive, “I think I’m the next to speak, so I
will bring it up then.”)

(From audience, April Sierra, 92 Summer Sky Drive, “Yes.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Please come to the microphone.
APRIL SIERRA, 92 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I apologize for my appearance today.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
It’s okay, it’s not a problem.
APRIL SIERRA, 92 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I’m April.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
You just have to give us your name and address.
APRIL SIERRA, 92 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
April Sierra, 92 Summer Sky Drive. I was at the last Meeting, I attended the other
meetings, I brought up a lot of concerns about the gas station. I suffer from disability
of asthma and my four (4) year old daughter has several breathing allergy issues as
well as myself. I had no idea that this gas station was going up until one night I saw
some couple of machines there and I thought to myself, “No, that can’t be, we would
get something in a letter, we would get some type of notification that they’re going to
start making this noise.” I had no preparation. I have documentation for my daughter;
since they’ve broken ground, my daughter has been to urgent care four (4) times, she’s
currently still on steroids, I’ve had an asthma attack just digging up that soil and cutting
down those trees. I’m highly allergic, I get allergy shots twice a week. I’m allergic to
trees, I’m allergic to everything that’s in that soil, all that stuff is just coming up. My
cars are covered in the morning when they originally broke ground. We had no
notification whatsoever; I couldn’t even say, “Well you know what, I have no control
over this happening, but let me leave my house when they first do it.” Like, that’s, I
think my concern and our concern as a community and as the residents is, where’s the
communication? I understand there’s meetings, we came to the meetings, but we were
cut off, it was closed after that. A simple letter stating that this is approved and this is
when they’re going to be breaking ground when it’s practically going to be in our front
yard is just respect. I mean we pay taxes, we, just like anybody else, and I’ve spoken
14

TB April 1, 2015
to, I apologize I forgot his name, but I did speak to the gentleman who’s in charge of
putting signs up and speed ordinances and he is aware of the concerns. I’m not the
only one and he said that he’s going to put signs up stating that there’s children on the
street and also put the machine there first so we can see how fast these people are
going by because they go sixty miles an hour (60 mph) sometimes, it’s used as a racing
street, now we have Fastrac right here. My other questions are, I have children. My
family personally has gone through something horrible; we know what drinking can do,
we know what gas stations can bring; it can bring trouble. I went and got an alarm
system in my house because I fear of what this can bring, it’s going to bring, if
someone goes in there and buys an ice cream, you can’t tell them that they have to
leave, they can hang out at the picnic table, it’s open twenty-four (24) hours. So, we’re
going to have that on our street. Is it going to increase burglaries? All this stuff that,
you know, I understand it’s commercial property, I understand that certain hands are
tied, but for our own health and respect as a community, I mean we work hard. Mr.
Goff is out there, I swear, before the sunset comes up, taking care of his property
making it look beautiful, planting flowers. Jeff, myself, I mean we’ve worked hard to
make our street look nice and not turn into East Henrietta looks by the expressway, just
run down, and I just feel that our residents that are being affected by the noise. My
daughter was up at six o’clock in the morning (6:00 A.M.) the other day; she said,
“Mom, I’m getting ready for school.” She doesn’t, she thought it was time to go to
school. It wasn’t time to go to school, she mistaken the construction noise for her
alarm clock. My house is shaking sometimes from the digging and everything. The gas
tanks are out there now. My kids are like, “Mom, what are those things, those things
look like humungous bombs.” It’s scary that it’s that close. I just ask, and I hope that
as a Supervisor and as a Town that you really enforce and pay attention to what’s going
to be going on and look out for us. I mean, our taxes aren’t going to be lowered
because Fastrac’s there, and that’s not fair. I mean, we’re basically two (2) steps in
front of commercial property now as well as the pollution and the littering of, people
are going to be throwing things, you know, in the woods when they drive by. I just,
there’s a lot of concerns; environmentally and all over the board and I’m just very, very
disappointed. I’ve grown up in Henrietta, I graduated in Henrietta, my whole family’s in
Henrietta and it’s just like, I feel like I’m being built out of Henrietta, like, it’s like one
Lego on top of another and eventually it’s going to be worse than Greece and that’s not
what I remember as a child of Henrietta and I just ask that if there’s any
accommodations that you can do for our residents, the ground’s already broken, we
can’t stop what’s happening, it’s done, but my house, my daughter’s house as these
things go on, we need to know. I mean when I went to high school and they put a
new roof on the building, my mom had to get a letter because I had to not go to school
because that would set my asthma off. Now I have a daughter who, literally the
doctors are like, “We don’t know, it’s out of control,” with her breathing and I brought
up the situation and they strongly believe that it could possibly be from, more likely
from all of this stuff being turned up. It’s just, it’s sad and when you drive by it, like
15

TB April 1, 2015
think about when you go home and if this was in front of your house, how you would
feel. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE

Reverend Goff, please.
REVEREND RUBEN GOFF, 100 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I’m a Baptist Preacher and I’m not going to take attacks, but I’m going to say this to
you, I’m hoping that you will make sure that somebody’s on the ball down there when
the flood starts. There’s going to be water there. I’m standing, when I walk out my
door, I’m in the middle of Summer Sky Drive, 100, so all the water comes to me and
then for the way they sloped the houses from Wildbriar, well then the water comes
down. I have to say the Town did a very good job of putting the culverts in there and
so forth and so on, to catch that water. Now, there’s still get a buildup of water in
there and from where I’m standing, if I’m standing now down in that area on the,
across the street, the way they are building it, they’re building it and all, everything is
sloped, it’s going to come down; the water’s going to come down. I’m mighty afraid. I
looked, I walked through there today, they said posted, but I walked all the way
through, go all the way around where they have that, bringing it in the back there, that
I don’t know how they’re going to do it, but they have everything so the water can
come in there and I’m hoping that you, or have somebody to go down there and check
on it because that’s going to be an area that I’m really concerned about. I’m concerned
about now, I don’t have to worry about what time it is now because six thirty (6:30)
lights are coming in everywhere, cars are coming everywhere. I know Summer Sky
Drive, that’s like the thruway at four (4), three thirty (3:30), from three thirty to six
thirty (3:30 – 6:30) it’s like the thruway, so Mr. Moore, that’s all I have to say right
now, but there is some things that you, the Town Supervisor, you have to stay on top
of it. That’s all I have to say.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. That’s all the people that I have signed up to speak. Can I have a motion
for adjournment please?

JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Hold on, I’ve got one (1) more thing. Sorry about that. I would like to know when I’m
going to be responded to with my questions. I’ve been waiting for eighteen (18)
years…

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “Good question.”)
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…eighteen (18) years, so…

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “[Inaudible] the answers.”)
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…how long do you think it would take you guys to respond to those, in writing?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, we have to look at the questions and we will respond.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Okay. Does that mean in a few weeks, or a month?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I mean, you’re welcome in my office any time for…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
And I will come in, you know me Jack.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, you were there as of last Friday even, so…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Don’t get me wrong, Jack, you’re a Henrietta man.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…okay, and…

…and I still like…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…there’s a lot…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…you guys…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…of questions here.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…I voted for you…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes, but Jeff, there’s some questions here that…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
They’re going to be quite difficult to answer.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…I couldn’t answer because you’re asking about some information back in 1997 that I
don’t have any knowledge of.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I think maybe with Mr. Mulligan he can help. He’s been here for thirty seven (37)
years.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well his memory sometimes isn’t really good. You can’t pick on him, he’s not here to…

His father passed away, you (inaudible).
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Oh, sorry about that.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
The funeral service was this morning.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
The news doesn’t work all over the place, so I didn’t hear…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well it obviously…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…I’m sorry about that.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…doesn’t work because some of these people here didn’t get notified so.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Right, right, so that’s what I think about that website. I think it could be beneficial to
put things in there that would be in plain English for the, so as soon as you get on
there, here’s the latest news, and to be honest with you, even bad news, Jack, is all
right.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well I think just telling the truth is fine.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I’m just saying, even bad news is okay because it’s part of accountability…

SUPERVISOR MOORE
This process wasn’t a closed process…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…and I’d like that.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…that they went through to approve this gas station.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
I’m fully aware of it. The problem is, when we fought for that piece of property in 1997
we didn’t cooperate and Mr. Breese was breaking the law. Now I caught him and then
I made a petition with three hundred (300) peoples’ signatures. We caught him, let’s
see, it started with a…
COUNCILMAN BREESE
You want to clarify…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…the direct…
COUNCILMAN BREESE
…that a little bit?
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…impact. The direct impact statement that he didn’t supply. It starts there.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
Maybe before you start throwing stuff out there like that you better…
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Oh, no, no these are facts. These are facts. Your father broke the law.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
Really? Did he go to jail?
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
No.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
Okay.

TB April 1, 2015
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
No. This all was held in…
COUNCILMAN BREESE

(Inaudible)

JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
…his office.
COUNCILMAN BREESE
You’re getting to the point Jeff where you’ve gone a little bit over the line.
JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
No, I haven’t. Your father threw me out of his office and then I had to go and get a
petition with three hundred (300) peoples’ signatures, he was about to throw me out of
his office again and I said, “Mr. Breese, if you throw me out of your office again I’m
going to have no choice but to tell these three hundred (300) voters of how you’re
treating me.” Now it sounds like you might be along his same feet path there. Be
careful where you tread.

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “Where will your answers be? On the website?”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
No, I’ll respond to Jeff with a letter and then he can share with you.

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “Okay.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
But some of them here, if they go back to 1997, I don’t have knowledge of.
anything we have knowledge of, I’d be glad to share.

But

JEFF KUEPPERS, 108 SUMMER SKY DRIVE
Maybe this young strapping lad can do it. He seems pretty ambitious.
DONALD A. YOUNGE, ESQ., TOWN ATTORNEY
Yes, maybe we can, listen this is a Public Comment period…
SUPERVISOR MOORE
He gets paid one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00) an hour, Jeff. I can write a letter
a lot cheaper.
