SUPERVISOR MOORE
There will be an opportunity for the people to speak on any Agenda item and I have
some people that are signed up. The first speaker would be Deborah Barsel.
DEBORAH BARSEL, 1802 RIVERS RUN
Hello, my name is Deborah Barsel, I live at 1802 Rivers Run and thank you for letting
me speak tonight. Rivers Run was a community, it still is a community, a very active
community for over fifty-five (55). It is based on natural environment and an
architectural dream that fits right in to the environment. We have been hearing about
plans for next door, the next door property for quite some time and basically have been
under attack since the beginning trying to figure out what is going on at that point and
have some sort of control over it. Now I would like to thank Richland and Rainaldi for
being very, very responsive to problems and questions that we raised. They were very
responsive and I appreciate that very much. However, my result, my answer is still, I
do not want student housing built right on the edge of where I’m living because I
believe that will be way too crowded, too noisy, it will increase traffic flow and basically
be counter to what the dream was that founded Rivers Run. Thank you very much for
letting me speak. Oh, one other thing. Now I know this cost money. My question to
you is, what goes into being able to issue municipal bonds, perhaps, to raise money for
this type of project of some alternate, more naturalistic project since many Henrietta
citizens have indicated their interest in more open space and naturalized space? Thank
you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you very much. The next speaker is Kathleen Hayes.

TB March 18, 2015
KATHLEEN HAYES, 402 RIVERS RUN
I also want to thank you for letting us speak tonight, and I have spoken before on this
issue. I’m going to speak on the proposed variance for student housing on East River
Road at the old Kodak facility. At this time I wish to ask the Town Board either to deny
the request for a variance to allow student housing or else decide to postpone making
any decisions on it for a while so that more options can be explored for the use of the
land. Mr. Rainaldi has a dream to restore the old Kodak facility. He’s drawn up lovely
plans for that and I hope he gets to do it for the old Kodak facility. He has also
developed a nightmare plan to put housing of seven hundred (700) college students on
the rest of the land. I would like to suggest that since two (2) different uses for this
land are being proposed, perhaps the parcel where the student housing would go could
be sold or given to the Town for use as a nature park. I am told that the Del Monte
Corporation offered to give this land to both RIT and the U of R, but they said, “No
thank you.” I can appreciate that neither school wanted the expense of restoring the
old Kodak property. If Mr. Rainaldi bought that facility and the land it is on, would Del
Monte consider gifting the parcel where the proposed student housing would go, to the
Town or perhaps selling it for a price the Town could afford, and maybe a bond issue
would help with that too. A very nice nature park could be developed with walking
paths, a picnic pavilion or two (2), and a boat launch for canoes and kayaks on nice
waterfront where the citizens of Henrietta could spend some quiet leisure time. This is
a golden opportunity to preserve lovely waterfront along the Genesee River with access
for those who would drive over to spend time in the nature park. Please give it serious
consideration. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. Beth Vanssen.

(From audience, Beth Vanfossen, 501 Rivers Run, “Vanfossen.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Oh, I’m sorry.

(From audience, Beth Vanfossen, 501 Rivers Run, “[inaudible]”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Yes.
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Yes, but that’s, yes you, okay.
BETH VANFOSSEN, 501 RIVERS RUN
Yes, thank you. My name is Beth Vanfossen, I live at 501 Rivers Run. I’ve sent you all
2

TB March 18, 2015
emails, three or four (3-4) of them and have appeared here several times and I’m sorry
to bore you again. I’m also very appreciative of your attention and replies and for the
time you have spent considering this subject. I also appreciate Richland Residential’s
attempts to meet our concerns. Nevertheless I still hope that you will, if any of you are
still on the edge in your decision, that you will reject their proposal. I just continue to
think and have thought all the way through, that seven hundred (700) students on that
size is a, could be a nightmare. It just seems ridiculous to me to have that many
people and I think that Henrietta may come to regret it and hope that Mr. Rainaldi can
find other uses for that northern parcel. A recent idea that came up was, which I’ve
expressed to you already, was to develop some sort of waterfront for Henrietta as has
been the case for Penfield and Pittsford and several other communities and wouldn’t it
be wonderful if they could bring their boats and there would be paths and other picnics
and weddings and so forth to use that land. The money, that’s definitely a problem,
but perhaps with some effort by community people funds could be gathered together
from various sources, environmental groups for example, and grants. It has been
done, how did these other communities get theirs started? There must be a way.
Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you very much. Next one is Mike Stafford, did you want to talk now, Mike, or
later?

(From audience, Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive, “I, it doesn’t matter, I could…”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well, is it on an Agenda item?

(From audience, Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive, “Yes.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Oh, yes.
MIKE STAFFORD, 32 ESSEX DRIVE
Mike Stafford, 32 Essex Drive. I did read the BME Associates report for the comments
and I did have, I thought it was kind of vague in a few things. One was the bus back
and forth and I read in the Resolution it speaks of adequate bus service, you know,
what I consider adequate, what you consider adequate and what a big business
considers adequate might be two (2) different things, or a lot of different things. You
know, they might think one (1) bus run a day is adequate. I do a lot of work out there
and I’m on East Henrietta Road, or East River Road quite often and at times the traffic
does get bad and I think that, I think you need to be, they need to be more clear on
what they mean by adequate. The other thing is the local labor. I asked a question
3

TB March 18, 2015
about local labor and in the report, it says yes it will use local labor. Well, is that one
percent (1%) of local labor or one hundred percent (100%) of local labor, what is, what
do they, they just say they will use local labor. Well they could, somebody could dig a
hole and they could say that’s local labor, so I’d be interested to know what percentage
of local labor they’re interested in. And the third (3rd) thing is the barrier between the
adjacent property. And we can say from personal experience we know it, they, you
know, they’re required to build a barrier but when, but if in five (5), ten (10), twenty
(20) years something happens to the barrier, there’s nobody there to make sure it gets
replaced, so the residents should know that. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you Mike. The next speaker’s Barry McVay.
BARRY MCVAY, 504 RIVERS RUN
Hi. I live at 504 Rivers Run and had the opportunity to speak with you before and the
privilege of getting to meet with you individually which added tremendous amount to
the feeling, the positive feeling that I have about working together. As I had written
earlier, I also found that you, you know, or understanding of some of the difficulties of
communication in terms of word choice and that. I had the impression that I might
have been coming across as somewhat oppositional at times or challenging, but it was
assured that that was, it was understood that I just feel strongly about this situation.
In relation to hearing at one point that the winds of decision making were changing,
having been away, I won’t rub it in about being in south Florida, but still being away I
was kind of amazed that it seemed that things had, what I was hearing, shifted quite a
bit. When I got back I was relieved to find that it was, the majority of folks that I left
that were not in favor of the student housing was as strong or more so than ever and
we also were able to align with the nature conservancy in terms of getting some
welcome support, now actually I’m finding, the more we talk that there’s some real
convergence between our areas of interest. At one of the, it was already mentioned
about the development of the former Riverwood Campus and the vision of the
construction of the architecture, I’ll trip over the name of the architect, but of the
beautiful building that Mr. Rainaldi wants to improve and the people are so excited
about being a part of the development, included the use of the land that surrounds it.
It seems to me that it would be contrary with a number of concerns that have been
mentioned to not have that, the natural setting that the developers, the architects that
formed those buildings had proposed. I think also with the issue that I mentioned
there, and I did, there was another poor choice of words, and I think that someone I
just saw come in to the building, Sally Howard will be able to speak…

(Bell ring)

TB March 18, 2015
BARRY MCVAY, 504 RIVERS RUN
…more to this than others, is the issue of the SEQR that with the, with Richland being
unregistered, as I understand it, in New York State that it, when RG & E happens to be
registered, that it would behoove us to take a look at more thoroughly investigating and
I’ll stop at this point with a, what I understand is a Section 1 SEQR to more thoroughly
investigate the environmental impact on this beautiful land that we have to work with
and I hope part of it turns into the marina that was mentioned as being a nice mixture
of combining the environmental with the business opportunities. Thank you very much.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. Mrs. McVay.

(From audience, Betsy Brugg, Woods Oviatt Gilman, “I have not signed anything, but I
think it would be appropriate for me to add my name to the list.”)
SUPERVISOR MOORE
That’s fine.
SUSAN MCVAY, 504 RIVERS RUN
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to reiterate why I remain opposed to the
Summit student housing project. The proposal for the recent student [inaudible] result
in density population there’s…

(From audience, unidentified speaker, “We can’t hear you.”)
SUSAN MCVAY, 504 RIVERS RUN
…the proposed number of buildings and students results in a density of population that
is too high for the space allotted. The buildings are too closely spaced and too many
unrelated people are residing under one (1) roof to comprise, I understand with current
Codes and variances would be needed. RIT says more student housing is unneeded
based on their enrollment projections and considering the many problems that
unaffiliated housing has posed, is also unwanted. I appreciate your willingness to listen
to my concerns and Richland’s willingness to make some changes, but I still believe
there’s no right way to do the wrong thing and I believe student housing on this parcel
of land is an inappropriate use of land. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. Sally Howard.
SALLY HOWARD, 24 KRAMER STREET
Good evening. I’m Sally Howard, resident on the other side of Town from the Richland
development at 24 Kramer Street and I acknowledge and I also applaud the developer’s
5

TB March 18, 2015
proposal to construct a wheelchair accessible trail and a canoe/kayak launch and to
dedicate a portion of the land to Henrietta for public parking and trail access to the
river. This parcel from the Exhibit P looks to be about two hundred foot (200’) wide,
which really is more of a narrow access trail than a public park. I believe a water, an
actual waterfront park in Henrietta would be a great asset to Henrietta and all its
residents since we need to drive to other Towns to get access to the river or the canal
and I think that that should be, this is our chance to be able to do that. This is, I mean
to consider how we could do that. Because this parcel of land has special attributes;
deep valley, hill of sandy, erodible soils, and wetlands and meadows and forest, stream
and abundant wildlife and also because the, a multiagency coordinated SEQR review
has not yet been performed and because this is something like a waterfront park in
Henrietta where the public could make use of the river, would be a great asset to
Henrietta and all of its residents, it is, I believe there’s currently not enough information
to determine if a special variance allowing a seven hundred (700) unit subdivision is a
sound decision and so therefore I request a Type I State Environmental Quality Review
with a positive declaration of negative impact and a full scope and a coordinated
multiagency review by all relevant municipalities and agencies and all impacted parties
being informed, and I request that we consider this to be, how we could have a
waterfront park on the river for Henrietta residents. I signed up for two (2) topics. My
other topic is only one sentence long, should I just segway in?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Is it the same, is it an Agenda item?
SALLY HOWARD, 24 KRAMER STREET
I believe so, is this, do you have the solar, it was…
COUNCILMAN PAGE
Yes.
SALLY HOWARD, 24 KRAMER STREET
…it was in the Workshop, solar panels.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Well that was part of the Workshop, but you can…
SALLY HOWARD, 24 KRAMER STREET
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
…say whatever you want, sure.
6

TB March 18, 2015
SALLY HOWARD, 24 KRAMER STREET
Okay. I do support the Town of Henrietta making use of solar power to reduce electric
bills and reduce the traditional electrical generation burden and the associated
pollutants. I encourage Henrietta to become, consider becoming a climate smart
community which then opens up the door for all sorts of grants from NYSERDA. Thank
you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you. Betsy, you’re the next speaker.

(From audience, Betsy Brugg, Woods Oviatt Gilman, “Sure.”)
BETSY BRUGG, WOODS OVIATT GILMAN
Thank you, Mr. Supervisor, members of the Town Board. So, I think, we’re a little
surprised to have, you always get the folks who still have issues or still have comments
who come to the Meetings, but our last neighborhood meeting, the project received
applause, so I think maybe I’ll start with a little bit of history and just remind the Board.
We started this process, there was a Public Hearing back in January. The project
looked very different at that time. There were several neighborhood meetings. Doug
Eldred, who’s around here somewhere, has spent a fair amount of time taking in and
digesting those comments and we’ve made some very major changes to the project
since its original inception and it includes many features that are not typical of any
development, let alone this particular development. So some of the things that I think
may not be understood, and I’m going to respond to all the comments, I tried to write
them all down here, I think there’s a little bit of a misconception and it actually makes
me think back to the days when Rivers Run itself was approved and they were the
outsider coming in to the neighborhood and I don’t know how many of you were
around at that time, but change was difficult at that time and change is difficult every
time there’s something different. We are not here for variance, I think that’s a
misunderstanding, or misconception on the part of some of the public, they may not
understand what the relief requested is. This property is actually zoned Industrial. I
was just scanning the Town Code at the list of thirty-eight (38) some odd
manufacturing assembly industrial uses that could be there, everything from tool
assembly to film manufacturing to, which of course is not popular these days, to a
dairy; there’s a lot of different things that could go there that would not involve any
type of recreational benefits to the community. We happen to have a top notch
developer that sort of spearheaded this whole idea by bringing Richland into Town,
Fred Rainaldi, who has an incredible track record. If you’ve been to High Point and
you’ve been over to the Armory at Culver Road, you’ll see he does incredible work.
This is not your typical type of quality developer and he has very high standards and he
selected Richland because of their high standards. So some of the work that’s gone
into this has involved increasing the buffer, has involved adding park land, park land
7

TB March 18, 2015
which the Town does not, I don’t know how much park land this Town has, if I
remember the Town has an extraordinary amount of park land.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thirteen hundred (1,300) acres.
BETSY BRUGG, WOOD OVIATT GILMAN
This is industrial zoned property, which the residents may not realize, has a tremendous
economic value; it’s worth thirty to sixty thousand dollars ($30,000.00 - $60,000.00) an
acre. There is a huge market for this property for industrial development. It is
extremely unlikely that anybody is going to be donating this land to the Town of
Henrietta and I think that’s something that people may not realize and whether, and I
doubt the Town has the resources, as much as we’d like to think that our government
can step in and buy park land when they like, it’s a very costly venture, so this is very
valuable industrial land, so Richland has really been focused on giving the Town and
their neighbors, they’re very aware of their neighbors, Fred Rainaldi is very aware of
the neighbors and the fact that he’s committed to this neighborhood as well, to give the
Town the very best quality project. The Town Code requires a sixty foot (60’) buffer;
we’ve moved it to one hundred and twenty feet (120’). We’ve preserved a tree line,
we’ve preserved additional trees on the property, we’re protecting the wetlands, we are
creating park land and access to the river. I don’t know if folks realize, but you’re not
going to get an industrial developer come in here and want to put a park on there for,
you know, nearby residents to stroll through, it’s just not going to happen. So there
are a lot of fabulous things that come with this project. I think there’s also,
unfortunately it’s sort of a negative connotation, people sort of have kind of this issue
with just students, I guess, but I don’t know that they’re aware of all of the security
measures that are in place. There’s a very tight leases, there will be onsite twentyfour-seven (24/7) available security assistance for the students. On the weekends
there’s going to be late night security there. There’s onsite cameras so that any type of
misconduct will be caught and dealt with immediately, so there’s very, very tight control
over the management of the property. There’ll be an onsite management office, so I
don’t think we’re going see any type of, you know, anything other than typical
residential behavior, whether they’re younger students or older students, I mean this is
a neighborhood that really thrives on RIT, it’s part of the RIT community, this is an area
characterized by RIT related uses, educational uses, residential uses, it’s really a very
appropriate use for the neighborhood. And I’ll go back to one of the comments from
the neighbors about this being a variance. A variance is a request to do something
that’s not allowed by the Code. That is not what we’re here to ask the Board to do.
We actually are here to ask for a Special Use Permit, which is a use that’s presumed to
be permitted by the Code and in fact it is tantamount to a legislative determination that
it is consistent with the zoning, so we are actually going through this process, but the
presumption is that the use is permitted and for that reason, you know I cannot see
8

TB March 18, 2015
any reason that the Board would actually be able to rely on to find that it somehow
wouldn’t meet those standards. We’ve addressed the standards, I think you’ve
probably seen them in writing, there’s a lot of material that’s been submitted, but more
importantly I think if you step back and take a look at the neighborhood and really think
about what’s being proposed, we do meet the requirements, we are consistent with the
character of the neighborhood. There’s some other benefits that I’m not sure if the
residents realize come with this project, so when we, you know, the Board knows this,
I’m not sure if the public knows this, and I think there was a comment about the SEQR.
So we have had a coordinated review under SEQR, this is technically not a Type I
Action, it’s an Unlisted Action, but nonetheless a full coordinated review and a long form
EAF was submitted for this project. So part of that process for us is to provide evidence
that we will not have adverse impact on traffic, evidence that we will not have adverse
impact on the wetlands. We’ve provided a market study, we’ve even supplemented
that market study to make it current to address the question of whether there is a
market for this project and I think our most recent amendment market study
specifically incorporates in there a very conservative assumption that there’ll be no
growth in the student population at RIT and we still have a strong market for the
project. So we’ve provided the Town with all of the studies and data that you need in
order to properly evaluate this. We’re not shooting from the hip, we’re not giving you,
you know, our opinion on the traffic, we’ve actually evaluated the traffic and in fact we
heard the neighbors. There are concerns about traffic on East River Road, that is an
honest concern that they have today. This project includes and at our request, we
went and worked with the Monroe County DOT on this, includes three hundred and fifty
thousand dollars ($350,000.00) worth of road improvements, which includes a traffic
signal at the entrance to this project with opportunities should RIT wish to connect
through to Rivers Run. That is a possibility; they have not wanted to do that, but that
is certainly something we were not opposed to. It includes adding a right turn lane and
it includes widening the shoulder of the road to six feet (6’) for pedestrians and all the
folks that are on the bicycles on the street to make the street safer. The Board may or
may not know this, but that is not something that the County said, “Wow, you need to
do a traffic signal,” we had to actually go and fight for that traffic signal and we are
willing to put that traffic signal in, so that’s a huge benefit I think to the community in
the current traffic conditions that they wouldn’t otherwise be getting. So there’s a lot of
benefits that come with this and hopefully they will see the value of that. You know I
think it’s very easy to say, “wow we love something that’s undeveloped and natural and
we want it to stay that way,” but that’s not a reality. This isn’t land that the Town
owns, I know the Board knows this, but I’m not sure that the public always is aware,
this is a very valuable, privately owned property and it will be developed; it’s industrially
zoned property so, we’ve, like I’ve said, we’ve done our very best to address each and
every issue that’s come up. A few of the other questions; the busing. Yes, we are
offering shuttle bus service; these are students that need to get to and from RIT for
class, so that is something that will be included as part of the project. There was a
9

TB March 18, 2015
question about local labor. Mr. Mehall is here from Richland, you know, this is very
preliminary, but they are, have no opposition, they are all in favor of using local labor,
they’re not trying to in any way short cut our local community from job opportunities,
that’s not something that they are focused on. I think, was there anything I missed
that you’d like me to cover?
SUPERVISOR MOORE
No, you got it all.
BETSY BRUGG, WOODS OVIATT GILMAN
Okay.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
Thank you.
BETSY BRUGG, WOODS OVIATT GILMAN

Discussion?
COUNCILMAN MULLIGAN
Under discussion, I’ll be voting no. Mr. Rainaldi has an excellent record, we’re all aware
of that throughout this entire area and I commend him for trying to renovate the Kodak
facility which has been in disrepair for many years but I’m very concerned about the
traffic as the residents have expressed, the shelter rents is a very open ended rental
agreement predicated on occupancy as well as utility cost, I’m not sure the Town will
get its fair share on that and bottom line I have a problem putting students next to a
senior facility. Its forty yards (40 yds.) away; I know they’ve made every effort to
provide a lot of concessions, but I just have a major problem with it. Thank you.

COUNCILWOMAN ZINCK
I want to add something too. I just want to thank all the neighbors, I know you’ve
been really concerned, you’re concerned residents. We share the same concern for the
Town, even if we don’t necessarily end up in the same place, and I think this has been
a really tough one, I think it’s been a really tough one for a lot of us where, you know,
if we could have just kept postponing it and not have to make a decision, that would
have been just great, but that’s not reality and I think some of the points that you
brought up, Betsy, are really, have been significant game changers for me, and that is I
know the projects from Mr. Rainaldi is going to be a first class project that I will be very
proud to have in Henrietta and I know all of us will and in order for that to happen, I
know it involved you needing to give up some of the land and recoup some of the
money for your project. Something’s going to go there and the reality that we could
purchase that when its industrial land is really unfortunately, not within our grasp and I
think this is probably one of the best uses, I remember when we were looking at it for a
casino a while ago, it was going to be a resort and a casino and an entertainment
venue and I look at this and I think we get the access to the water and I see a lot of
benefits for the community, so I’ll be voting yes on this. Thank you.
SUPERVISOR MOORE
I’d just like to thank all parties involved. This has probably been one of the toughest
decisions that I’ve been involved in since I’ve been on the Town Board, trying to take
everybody’s opinion and considerations into consideration and the getting of Richland
and the Rainaldi people, I think they’re going to be great neighbors and I think we’re all
going to be proud of this project and I know maybe it wasn’t were some people wanted
to be, but I commend everybody for the cooperation and the discussion and
communication that came about. I’m proud of my community, to be honest with you,
and I will be voting yes. (Pause, no further comments) Please call the roll.
